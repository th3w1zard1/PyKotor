# Current Task: Panda3D Backend Implementation

## Current Objective
Implementing core Panda3D scene management and model rendering system

## Context
- Converting from OpenGL to Panda3D backend
- Need to maintain API compatibility
- Must support all existing model formats and features

## Next Steps

1. Complete Scene class implementation
   - Add collision system for picking
   - Implement proper camera controls
   - Add scene graph management

2. Implement Mesh class
   - Convert vertex data to Panda3D format
   - Handle textures and materials
   - Support MDL file format

3. Create shader system
   - Port existing shaders to Panda3D
   - Implement texture management
   - Add material support

## Current Progress
- Basic Scene class structure created
- Initial window and camera setup done
- Basic lighting implemented

## Notes
- Need to ensure performance optimization
- Must maintain compatibility with existing PyKotor systems
- Consider adding debug visualization tools
