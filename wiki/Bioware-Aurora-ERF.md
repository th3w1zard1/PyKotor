BioWare Aurora Engine
Encapsulated Resource File Format
NOTICE: This documentation provides information about specific file formats used with the BioWare Aurora Engine.
It is intended for the use of software developers to create third-party software to work with the BioWare Aurora Engine
and the BioWare Aurora Toolset. While this documentation is provided as a service, we may or may not provide
updates, fixes and additions to the information provided herein. We reserve the right to change file formats without
updating the documentation. Please refer to the For Developers FAQ (<http://nwn.bioware.com/developers/faq.html>) and
the NWN End User License Agreement (EULA) for more information.
The Encapsulated Resource File (ERF) format is one of BioWare's methods of packing multiple files into a
single file so that they may be treated as a single unit. In this regard, it is similar to .zip, .tar, or .rar.
BioWare Aurora Engine/Toolset files that use the ERF format include the following: .erf, .hak, .mod, and
.nwm.

### NULL

The Reserved part of the ERF header allows for additional properties to be added to the file format later
while maintaining backward compatibility with older ERFs.
ERF Localized String List
The Localized String List is used to provide a description of the ERF. In .mod files, this is where the
module description is stored. For example, during the Load Module screen in NWN (a BioWare Aurora
Engine game), the module descriptions shown in the upper right corner are taken from the Localized String
List. The game obtains the current Language ID from dialog.tlk, and then displays the ERF String whose
LanguageID matches the dialog.tlk language ID.
String List Format
The String List contains a series of ERF String elements one after another. Note that each element has
a variable size, encoded within the element itself. The LanguageCount from the ERF Header specifies
the number of String List Elements.
String Table Size
String List Element 0
. . .
String List Element 1
String List Element N - 1
String List Element 2

String List Element Structure
Each String List Element has the following structure:
LanguageID
32 bit
StringSize
32 bit
String

Variable size as specified by the StringSize field

In .erf and .hak files, the String portion of the structure is a NULL-terminated character string. In
.mod files, the String portion of the structure is a non-NULL-terminated character string.
Consequently, when reading the String, a program should rely on the StringSize, not on the presence
of a null terminator.
Language IDs
The following is a list of languages and their IDs:
Language
ID
English
0
French
1
German
2
Italian
3
Spanish
4

Korean

Chinese Simplified

Japanese
131
Note, however, that the LanguageID actually stored in an ERF does not match up exactly to the
LanguageIDs shown in the above table. Instead, it is 2 times the Language ID, plus the Gender (0 for
neutral or masculine, 1 for feminine).
ERF Key List
The ERF Key List specifies the filename and filetype of all the files packed into the ERF.
Key List Format
The Key List consists of a series of Key structures one after another. Unlike the String List elements,
the Key List elements all have the same size. The EntryCount in the ERF header specifies the number
of Keys.
Key List Element 0
. . .
Key List Element 1
Key List Element N - 1
Key List Element 2

Key Structure
Each Key List Element has the following structure:
ResRef

16 bytes

Filename
ResID

32 bit

Resource ID, starts at 0 and increments
ResType

16 bit

File type
Unused

16 bit

NULLs

The ResRef is the name of the file with no null terminator and in lower case. A ResRef can only
contain alphanumeric characters or underscores. It must have 1 to 16 characters, and if it contains less
than 16 characters, the remaining ones are nulls.
The ResID in the key structure is redundant, because the its possible to get the ResID for any ERF
Key by subtracting the OffsetToKeyList from its starting address and dividing by the size of a Key
List structure.
When a file is extracted from an ERF, the ResRef is the name of the file after it is extracted, and the
ResType specifies its file extension. For a list of ResTypes, see the section on ResTypes later in this
document.
ERF Resource List
The Resource List specifies where the data for each file is located and how big it is.

Resource List Format
The Resource List looks just like the Key list, except that it has Resource List elements instead of Key
List elements. The ERF header's EntryCount specifies the number of elements in both the Key List
and the Resource List, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between Keys and Resource List
elements.
Resource List Element 0
. . .
Resource List Element 1
Resource List Element N - 1
Resource List Element 2

Resource List Element Structure
Each Resource List Element corresponds to a single file packed into the ERF. The Resource structure
specifies where the data for the file begins inside the ERF, and how many bytes of data there are.
OffsetToResource

32 bit

offset to file data from beginning of ERF
ResourceSize

32 bit

number of bytes
Resource Data
After the Resource List, all the data in an ERF consists of raw data for all the files that the ERF contains.
The data for one file is packed right up against the data for the next file. The offsets and sizes in the
Resource List specify where one file ends and another begins.
Resource Types
In an ERF Key, the ResType field specifies the file type of the associated file. See Section 1.3 of the Key
and BIF File Format document for a table containing ResType values and their meanings.
