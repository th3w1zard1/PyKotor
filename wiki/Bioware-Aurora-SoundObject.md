Sound Object Format

1. Introduction
A Sound object is a source of sounds that play in an Area. They may be positional, playing from a
specific location, or they may be area-wide, sounding the same regardless of where in the area the
listener is.
Sounds are stored in the game and toolset using BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF), and it is
assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with GFF.
Sound objects can be blueprints or instances. Sound blueprints are saved as GFF files having a UTS
extension and "UTS " as the FileType string in their header. Sound instances are stored as Sound
Structs within a module's GIT files.
2. Sound Struct
The tables in this section describe the GFF Struct for a Sound object. Some Fields are only present on
Instances and others only on Blueprints.
For List Fields, the tables indicate the StructID used by the List elements.
2.1 Common Sound Fields
The Table below lists the Fields that are present in all Sound Structs, regardless of where they are
found.
Table 2.1: Fields in all Sound Structs
Label
Type
Description
Active

### BYTE

1 if the Sound is active and plays.
0 if the Sound is inactive and is not currently playing
any wave files. Inactive Sounds can be manually
activated via scripting.
Continuous

### BYTE

1 if the Sound is continuous, or seamlessly looping. A
continuous sound must have exactly one wave file to
play, and it loops that wave continuously, over and
over with no pauses.
0 if the sound is not continuous. That is, it consists of
one or more wave files played individually. These
waves may play in sequence, in random order, or with
random or non-random pauses inbetween them.

If a Sound is Continuous, then the values of the
following Fields are ignored and always treated as 0:
Interval, IntervalVrtn, PitchVariation, Random,
RandomPositional, RandomRangeX, RandomRangeY,
VolumeVrtn.
Elevation

### FLOAT

Elevation of the Sound above or below the XYZ

position at which it is placed in the toolset. When it
plays, the audio emanates from the elevated position.
Elevation can be negative.
Hours

### DWORD

Set of bit flags specifying which hours of the day the
sound will play in. Bit 0 is hour 00h00, bit 6 is 06h00,
bit 14 is 14h00, etc.
Interval

### DWORD

Interval in milliseconds between playing sounds in the
Sound's list of waves.
IntervalVrtn

### DWORD

Interval Variation measured in milliseconds.
Each time a wave file finishes playing, determine how
long to wait before playing the next one.Ggenerate a
random number ranging from (-InternalVrtn) to
(+IntervalVrtn), and add that to the Interval. If the
resulting value is negative, treat it as 0 and play the
next wave immediately.
LocName
CExoLocString
Name of the Sound as it appears on the toolset's Sound
palette and in the Name field of the toolset's Sound
Properties dialog.
Does not appear in game.
Looping

### BYTE

1 if the Sound repeatedly plays its waves.
0 if the Sound plays its waves at most once then
becomes inactive.
MaxDistance

### FLOAT

Radius in meters outside which a listener cannot hear
the Sound at all.
Must be greater than or equal to the MinDistance.
MinDistance

### FLOAT

Radius in meters inside which a listener hears the
Sound at maximum volume.
Must be less than or equal to the MaxDistance.
PitchVariation

### FLOAT

Pitch variation when playing waves in the Sound's lis t
of waves, measured in octaves. Values from 0 to 1.0.
A 0 pitch variation means the Sound always plays at
normal pitch. A variation of 1 means that each time the
a wave plays, its pitch is randomly anywhere from 0 to
1 octave higher or lower than normal.
Positional

### BYTE

1 if the Sound plays from a specific position. The
volume changes depending on the distance of the
listener, and the relative volume from each
speaker/headphone changes depending on the direction
of the listener from the Sound.
0 if the Sound is area-wide, and has the same volume
regardless of where the listener is in relation to the
Sound. An area-wide Sound has no directional
variation by speaker.
Priority

### BYTE

Index into prioritygroups.2da.
Random

### BYTE

1 if the waves in the Sound's wave list are chosen
randomly each time one finishes playing.
0 if the waves are played in sequential order.
RandomPosition

### BYTE

1 if the XYZ position of the Sound source varies
randomly between the RandomRangeX and
RandomRangeY.
0 if the position of the sound does not vary.
This Field is ignored for area-wide (Positional=0)
sounds.
RandomRangeX
RandomRangeY

### FLOAT

Random distance in meters from the Sound's XYZ
position from which the Sound plays each time it plays

a wave.
These Fields are ignored if Positional=0 or
RandomPosition=0.
Sounds
List
The Sound's wave list. A list of wave files to play.
Each Struct in the List has Struct ID 0, and contains a
single CResRef Field called Sound, which is the
ResRef of a WAV file.
Tag
CExoString
Tag of the Sound. Up to 32 characters.
TemplateResRef
CResRef
For blueprints (UTS files), this should be the same as
the filename.
For instances, this is the ResRef of the blueprint that
the instance was created from.
Times

### BYTE

Times of day in which to play the Sound.
0 = time-specific. Use the Hours Field to determine
when to play.
1 = Day
2 = Night
3 = Always
If the Sound plays during the Day or Night, then day
and night are as defined by the Mod_DawnHour and
Mod_DuskHour Fields in the module's module.ifo file.
See Table 2.1 of the IFO document.
Volume

### BYTE

Volume to play each wave file at. Ranges from 0 (min)
to 127 (full)
VolumeVrtn

### BYTE

Volume Variation from 0 to 127.
Each time a wave is to be played, randomly select a
number from (-VolumeVrtn) to (+VolumVrtn) and add
it to the Volume, then clamp the result to the range of 0
to 127 and use that as the actual volume.
The various combinations of the Looping and Random properties merit additional explanation as to
how they interact with each other. There are four options for playing multiple sounds.
Continuously choose a new random sound to play (Random 1, Looping 1) - A sound is randomly
chosen from the sound list and played. Once it has played and the Interval period has passed, another
sound is randomly picked from the list and played. The process repeats forever or until the
SoundObjectStop() scripting function is called.
Play a randomly selected sound once (Random 1, Looping 0) - One sound is randomly chosen from the
list and played. After that, this sound object becomes inactive and no more sounds are played. The
sound object can be reactivated via the SoundObjectPlay() scripting function. This option is most
useful if Active is initially false, and the sound object is manually triggered during the game by using a
script.
Continuously play sounds in order (Random 0, Looping 1) - The first sound in the sound list is played,
then there is a pause corresponding to the Interval, then the next sound is played, then there is a pause
corresponding to the interval, and so on until all the sounds have played. This process repeats forever
or until scripted to stop.
Play list in order once (Random 0, Looping 0) - The sounds are played in order with an Interval delay
between them, and once all the sounds have played, the current sound object deactivates and does not
play again. This option is most useful if Active is false, and the Sound is manually triggered during the
game by using a script.

PaletteID

### BYTE

ID of the node that the Sound Blueprint appears under
in the Sound palette.
TemplateResRef
CResRef
The filename of the UTS file itself. It is an error if this
is different. Certain applications check the value of this
Field instead of the ResRef of the actual file.
If you manually rename a UTS file outside of the
toolset, then you must also update the TemplateResRef
Field inside it.
2.3. Sound Instance Fields
A Sound Instance Struct in a GIT file contains all the Fields in Table 2.1, plus those in Table 2.3
below.

GeneratedType

### BYTE

0 if manually placed by the module builder in the
toolset.
1 if autogenerated by the Area Properties dialog as part
of the current Area's Ambient Day or Ambient Night
Sound. See the AmbientSndDay and AmbientSndNight
properties in Table 3.2 and 3.3 of the Area format
document.
If GeneratedType is 1, then the Sound instance is
subject to automatic deletion when the user picks a
different ambient sound for the area.
TemplateResRef
CResRef
For instances, this is the ResRef of the blueprint that
the instance was created from.
XPosition
YPosition
ZPosition

### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of the Sound within the Area that it
is located in.
2.4. Sound Game Instance Fields
After a GIT file has been saved by the game, the Sound Instance Struct not only contains the Fields in
Table 2.1 and Table 2.3, it also contains the Fields in Table 2.4.
INVALID_OBJECT_ID is a special constant equal to 0x7f000000 in hex.

3. The 2DA Files Referenced by Sound Fields
3.1. Priority Groups
In a Sound Struct, the Priority Field is an index into prioritygroups.2da. Table 3.1.1 describes the
columns in the 2da.
The game and toolset are hardcoded to reference particular rows in prioritygroups, so only the
programmers may change the order of rows, or add or remove rows.

Integer
Matches up to hardcoded integer constants in sound engine
source code. This means that you may not add, remove,
or modify the order of rows in prioritygroups.2da.
Volume
Integer
Volume from 0 to 127
MaxPlaying
Integer
Maximum number of sounds of this priority that may play
simultaneously.
Interrupt
Integer
0 if sound may be interrupted
1 if sound may not be interrupted
FadeTime
Integer
When stopping the sound, number of milliseconds of
fadeout.
MaxVolumeDist
Integer
For placed Sound objects instances, the MaxDistance
overrides this 2da value.
MinVolumeDist
Integer
For placed Sound objects instances, the MinDistance
overrides this 2da value.
PlaybackVariance
Float
Pitch variance in octaves when playing sounds of this
priority. Range is 0 to 1.0.
For placed Sound objects instances, the PitchVariance
overrides this 2da value.
Sound objects edited in the toolset always have the priority groups listed in Table 3.1.2, in accordance
with the values of their Looping and Positional Fields. The other rows in prioritygroups.2da are used
for sounds generated by the game.

3.2. Default Values
There are two 2da files that determine the default values of various Sound object Fields when the user
creates a new sound using the Sound Wizard in the toolset. The Sound Wizard is hardcoded to look up
certain rows in the sounddefaults 2da files depending on the options that the user selected within the
Wizard's GUI.
