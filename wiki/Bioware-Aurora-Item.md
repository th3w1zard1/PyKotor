1. Introduction
1.1. Overview
An Item is an object that can be placed in an area, or carried in a container, whether the container be a
creature, placeable object, or store.
Items are stored in the game and toolset using BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF), and it is assumed
that the reader of this document is familiar with GFF.
Items can be blueprints or instances. Item blueprints are saved as GFF files having a UTI extension and
"UTI " as the FileType string in their header. Item instances are stored as Item Structs within a
module's GIT files.
1.2. Terminology
icon: the 2D image of an item as it appears in a player's inventory. The term "icon" may refer to the
entire image, or to the component parts of the image, if the inventory icon is constructed from several
other images.
model: the 3D model of an item as it appears in the game environment. This may refer to the model as
seen when equipped by the player or when lying on the ground. An item's equipped model and ground
model may or may not be the same, and not all items have equipped models.
2. Item Struct
The tables in this section describe the GFF Struct for an Item. Some Fields are only present on Instances
and others only on Blueprints.
For List Fields, the tables indicate the StructID used by the List elements.
2.1 Common Item Fields
2.1.1. Item Fields in All Items
The Table below lists the Fields that are present in all Item Structs, regardless of whether they are found
in blueprints, instances, toolset data, or game data.

2.1.2. Additional Item Fields by ModelType
The BaseItem of an item specifies a row in baseitems.2da that provides information on the item type.
One of the columns in baseitems.2da is the ModelType, which controls what the item looks like. Refer
to the ModelType entry in Table 4.1.1.
Depending on the ModelType, an Item Struct will contain the Fields listed in one or more of the tables
below, in addition to those in Table 2.1.1.

specified by the CostTable Field.

Must always be specified.
Param1

### BYTE

Index into iprp_paramtable.2da. Specifies a params
table.

This value is -1 if there are no parameters. There are 2
ways to determine if there are no parameters depending
on whether the ItemProperty struct has a non-zero
Subtype Field or not.

If there is a Subtype: there are no parameters if the
Param1ResRef column does not exist in the subtype
table (see the Subtype Field description in this struct)
or if there is a Param1ResRef column and the value is
**** in the row indexed by the Subtype Field.

is different. Certain applications check the value of this
Field instead of the ResRef of the actual file.
If you manually rename a UTI file outside of the
toolset, then you must also update the TemplateResRef
Field inside it.
2.3. Item Instance Fields
An Item Instance Struct in a GIT file contains all the Fields in Table 2.1.1, plus those in Table 2.3

Structs document.
3. InventoryObject Struct
An InventoryObject is a Struct that may be present in the inventory list of a Container object. Creatures,
Items, and Placeable Objects can all be Containers.
A Container Item contains a Field called ItemList, of GFF type List, containing InventoryObject Structs.
Items in the toolset never have an ItemList, but they can in a savegame (inside the GIT and/or IFO files)
or character file (BIC). The game saves the StructIDs as being equal to the index of the Struct element
within the ItemList.

3.4. InventoryObject Game Instance Fields
An Item Instance Struct in a GIT file contains all the Fields in Table 3.1, plus those in Item Game
Instances, as given in Tables 2.1.1, 2.3, and 2.4.
The XOrientation is always 1.0, and the YOrientation and 3 Position Fields are always 0.0.
Character files use the same format as savegames for InventoryObjects, except that they do not include
the Fields in Table 2.4.
4. Calculations and Procedures
4.1. Icon and Model Part Availability
The icons and model resources for items have ResRefs that end in a 3-digit, zero-padded numerical
string.
Examples: helm_001.mdl, pmh0_bicepl006.mdl, waxbt_b_011.mdl, iwaxbt_t_011.tga.
This section describes how to determine the ResRefs (aka filenames) of the model and icon resources
for an item, depending on its ModelType as specified in baseitems.2da. In the descriptions below, the
following tokens are used:
•
<ItemClass> = the ItemClass from baseitems.2da.
•
<number> = part number
If an item model cannot be found, then the MDL file specified by the DefaultModel column in
baseitems.2da will be used instead.
If an item icon cannot be found, then the icon specified by the DefaultIcon column in baseitems.2da
will be used instead.
The icon for an item must have dimensions equal to 32 pixels multiplied by the InvSlotWidth and
InvSlotHeight values from baseitems.2da.
4.1.1. Simple
Model = <ItemClass>*<number>.mdl
(eg., it_torch_001.mdl)
Icon = i<ItemClass>*<number>.tga
(eg., iit_torch_001.tga)
Simple item types typically use one model for all variants, with only the icon being different.
The available icons in the toolset consist of all existing TGA icons from the MinRange to the
MaxRange as specified in baseitems.2da, using the Icon ResRef naming convention given above.
4.1.2. Layered
Model = <ItemClass>_<number>.mdl

## Page 9

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
(eg., helm_001.mdl)
Icon = i<ItemClass>*<number>.plt
(eg., ihelm_001.plt)
The available parts are determined by scanning for all existing PLT icons from the MinRange to the
MaxRange as specified in baseitems.2da, using the Icon ResRef naming convention given above. If an
icon exists, assume that the MDL also exists and make that part number selectable in the toolset.
(Exception: for helmets: check for the MDL instead of the PLT)
4.1.3. Composite
Model = <ItemClass>*<position>*<number>.mdl
(eg., waxbt_b_011.mdl, waxbt_m_011.mdl, waxbt_t_011.mdl)
Icon = i<Model ResRef>.tga
(eg., iwaxbt_b_011.tga, iwaxbt_m_011.tga, iwaxbt_t_011.tga)
The <position> is one of the following letters: b (bottom), m (middle), or t (top), usually corresponding
to the pommel, hilt, or blade of a weapon.
For weapons, the 3-digit <number> field is broken up into two parts. The first 2 digits map to a
physical shape variant, and the last digit is a color variant. For example, parts 011, 021, and 031 all
have the same color, but different shapes. Parts 011, 012, and 013 all have the same shape, but
different colors.
To determine what colors are available for each of the b, m, and t portions of a composite item, do the
following steps. Scan for icons, incrementing the <number> from the baseitems.2da MinRange to
MaxRange, and find first icon file that exists. Check the color code in the icon's resref (the last digit).
This is the minimum available color. Increment the <number> from there until another icon is found
that has the same color. Recall what color the icon was before that. That color is the maximum
available color.
To determine what shapes are available, scan for TGA icons from <number> = (MinRange + minimum
color) to <number> = MaxRange, incrementing by 10 each time. If an icon exists, then assume that all
the MDL file exists as well, and also assume that the shape variant exists in all the other colors as well.
For example, suppose that the minimum color found earlier was 2, the maximum color was 4,
MinRange = 10, and MaxRange = 100. The icon scan would check for 012, 022, 032, ... 092. If 082
exists, for example, then assume that 083 and 084 also exist
When drawing the Icon for a composite item, the 3 portions are painted one after the other in the order:
bottom, middle, top. The order is important because the icons overlap.
4.1.4. Armor
Model = p<gender><race><phenotype>*<bodypart><number>.mdl

(eg., pmh0_chest001.mdl)
Icon = ip<gender>_<bodypart><number>.plt

## Page 10

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>

(eg., ipm_chest001.plt)
where
<gender> = m or f
<bodypart> = belt, bicepl, bicepr, chest, footl, footr, forel, forer, handl, handr, legl, legr, neck,
pelvis, shinl, shinr, shol, shor--as listed in capart.2da
The complete icon for an Armor item consists of several individual bodypart icons drawn onto a
surface in the following order: pelvis, chest, belt, right shoulder, left shoulder, robe. The order is
important because the icons may overlap. There are no icons for the other body parts.

For each <bodypart>, the available <number> values are determined by checking the appropriate
parts_<armorpart>.2da file, as given in Table 4.1.4 below.
Table 4.1.4: Armor body part and parts 2da matchups

neck
parts_neck
pelvis
parts_pelvis
robe
parts_robe
shinl
shinr
parts_shin
shol
shor
parts_shoulder
If a row in the parts_<armorpart>.2da file has an ACBONUS column value that is not ****, then the
<number> equal to that row index is available as a selectable bodypart. Note that in some cases, part
000 is available even though there are no 000 MDL or PLT files for armor. If part 000 is selected, then
that armor part is empty. (For example, no shoulder or belt, or no robe.)
In the toolset, the available parts are sorted in order of increasing ACBONUS as listed in the parts 2da.
If several parts have identical ACBONUS, then they are sorted in order of increasing row number. Note
that for all armor parts except the chest, the ACBONUS 2da value is used only for sorting part
numbers, and do not actually affect the AC of the armor.
Robe parts are different from other armor parts in that they may hide other parts. A robe-hidden part
does not appear in the armor icon, and its 3D model is not rendered. The parts_robe.2da file contains
additional columns beyond those normally present in a parts 2da. There exists one column for every
other part, each one titled HIDE<PART>, where <PART> is one of the values in the Body Part

## Page 11

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
column of Table 4.1.4. For example, HIDEFOREL, HIDELEGR and HIDECHEST. Each
HIDE<PART> column contains a 1 if the specified part is hidden by the robe, or 0 if not.
4.2. Property Availability
To determine which Item Properties are available for a given base item type, get the number in the
PropColumn column from baseitems.2da (Table 5.1), then find the column in itemprops.2da (Table
5.3) that starts with that number in its name. If a row in itemprops.2da has 1 as the value under that
column, then the Item Property for the corresponding row in itempropdefs.2da (Table 5.2) is available
for the baseitem. If the value in itemprops.2da is ****, then the corresponding Item Property in
itempropdefs.2da is not available.
For example, baseitem 12 (amulet) has 16 as its PropColumn value. Thus, the available Item Properties
are determined by checking under the column "16_Misc" in itemprops.2da. This means that AC Bonus
vs. Alignment is available for amulets but Enhancement Bonus is not.
4.3. Property Description Construction
The format used by the toolset for an item property description is:
PropertyName : Subtype [CostValue] [Param1: Param1Value]
eg., Damage Bonus vs. Racial Type: Dragon [1 Damage] [Type: Acid]
eg., On Hit: Daze [DC = 14] [Duration: 50% / 2 rounds]
eg., Light [Dim (5m)] [Color: Blue]
The game uses similar formatting, but without the square brackets.
This section describes how to get the text for the various components of an Item Property description.
4.3.1. PropertyName
Look up the StrRef stored in column 0 (should be Name) of itempropdef.2da (Table 5.2), at the row
indexed by the ItemProperty Struct's PropertyName Field (see Table 2.1.3). This StrRef points to the
name of the Item Property (eg., "Damage Bonus vs. Racial Type", "On Hit", "Light")
4.3.2. Subtype
In itempropdef.2da, look up the SubTypeResRef column value at the row indexed by the ItemProperty
Struct's PropertyName Field. If it is ****, then there are no subtypes for this Item Property, so there is
no subtype portion of the Item Property description. Otherwise, the string under this column is the
ResRef of the subtype table 2da.
If there is a subtype table, load it and use the ItemProperty Struct's Subtype Field as an index into the
2da. Get the StrRef from the name column. This StrRef points to the name of the Subtype (eg.,
"Dragon", "Daze").
4.3.3. CostTable Value
In itempropdef.2da, look up the CostTableResRef number at the row indexed by the ItemProperty
Struct's PropertyName Field. This should be the same as the ItemProperty Struct's CostTable Field.

## Page 12

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
Use the CostTableResRef value as an index into iprp_costtable.2da and get the string under the Name
column. This is the ResRef of the cost table 2da to use.
Load the cost table 2da. Using the ItemProperty Struct's CostValue Field as an index into the cost table,
get the Name column StrRef. This StrRef points to the name of the Cost value (eg., "1 Damage", "DC =
14", "Dim (5m)")
4.3.4. Param
Get the ResRef of the Param Table.
If the ItemProperty has a subtype table (see Section 4.3.2), then look for a Param1ResRef column in the
subtype table. This column contains the param table index, and should be identical the Param1 Field of
the ItemProperty Struct.
If the ItemProperty does not have a subtype table, or the subtype table does not have a Param1ResRef
column, then look under the Param1ResRef column in itempropdef.2da, and use that as the param
table index. In this case as well, the index should equal the Param1 Field of the ItemProperty Struct.
Use the param table index as an index into iprp_paramtable.2da. Look under the Name column for a
StrRef, and look under the TableResRef column for a string. The Name StrRef points to the text for the
name of the parameter (eg., "Type", "Duration", "Color"). The TableResRef string is the ResRef of the
param table 2da.
Use the ItemProperty Struct's Param1Value as an index into the param table found above, and get the
StrRef under the "Name" column. This StrRef points to the name of the param value (eg., "Acid", "50%
/ 2 Rounds", "Red")
4.4. Cost Calculation
The cost of an item is determined by the following formula:
ItemCost = [BaseCost + 1000*(Multiplier^2 - NegMultiplier^2) + SpellCosts]*MaxStack*BaseMult +
AdditionalCost
where:
BaseMult = ItemMultiplier column value from baseitems.2da.
AdditionalCost = AddCost Field from the Item Struct.
and the other terms are as defined in the following subsections:
4.4.1. Base Cost
BaseCost = BaseCost column value from baseitems.2da for all items except armor.
For armor, BaseCost is the cost in armor.2da for the armor's base AC. The armor's base AC is the
ACBONUS from parts_chest.2da, using the part number of the chest as the index into parts_chest.2da.
4.4.2. Multipliers
Multiplier is the sum of the costs of all the Item Properties whose costs are positive. That is:

## Page 13

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
NegMultiplier is the sum of the costs of all Item Properties whose costs are negative.
If an Item Property has a PropertyName of 15 (Cast Spell), then omit it from the
Multiplier/NegMultiplier totals. It will be handled when calculating the SpellCosts instead.
To calculate the cost of a single Item Property, use the following formula:
ItemPropertyCost = PropertyCost + SubtypeCost + CostValue
Add the ItemProperty's cost to the Multiplier total if it is positive. Add it to the NegMultiplier total if it
is negative.
Note that Item Property Params do not affect Item Property cost.
The PropertyCost, SubtypeCost, and CostValue terms are obtained as described below.
PropertyCost
In itempropdef.2da, get the floating point value in the Cost column, at the row indexed by the
PropertyName Field of the ItemProperty Struct. If the Cost column value is ****, treat it as 0. This
floating point value is the PropertyCost.
SubtypeCost
If the PropertyCost obtained above from itempropdef.2da was 0, then get the ResRef in the
SubTypeResRef column of itempropdef.2da, at the row indexed by the 2PropertyName Field of the
ItemProperty Struct. This is the resref of the subtype table 2da.
In the subtype 2da, get the floating point value in the Cost column at the row indexed by the Subtype
Field of the ItemProperty Struct. This floating point value is the SubtypeCost.
Only get the SubtypeCost if the PropertyCost was 0. If the PropertyCost was greater than 0, then the
SubtypeCost is automatically 0 instead.
CostValue
In iprp_costtable.2da, get the string in the Name column at the row indexed by the CostTable Field in
the ItemProperty Struct. This is the ResRef of the cost table 2da.
In the cost table, get the floating point value in the Cost column in the row indexed by the CostValue
Field in the ItemProperty Struct. This floating point value is the CostValue.
4.4.3. Cast Spell Costs
To calculate the cost of a single Cast Spell Item Property, use the following formula:
CastSpellCost = (PropertyCost + CostValue)* SubtypeCost
The PropertyCost, SubtypeCost, and CostValue terms are obtained in the same way as for non-
CastSpell Item Properties.
After calculating all the CastSpellCost values for all the Cast Spell Item Properties, modify them as
follows:
•
Most expensive: multiply by 100%
•
Second most expensive: multiply by 75%

## Page 14

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
•
All others: multiply by 50%
After adjusting the CastSpellCosts, add them up to obtain the total SpellCosts value. Use the total
SpellCosts to calculate the total ItemCost using the formula given at the very beginning of Section 4.4.
4.5. Required Lore and Level
The character level required to use an item is equal to 1 plus the row index in itemvalue.2da that
contains the smallest number in the MAXSINGLEITEMVALUE column that is still greater than or
equal to the cost of the item.
The Lore skill check required to identify an item is equal to the row index in skillvsitemcost.2da that
contains the smallest number in the DeviceCostMax column that is still greater than or equal to the cost
of them item.
5. Item-related 2DA Files
5.1. Base Items
The baseitems 2da defines all the item types that exist. Many characteristics of an item are determined
by its base item type and cannot be set by the addition of ItemProperties to its PropertiesList. These
characteristics are defined in baseitems.2da.

The <string> in the column name is unimportant and
present only for the convenience of the programmer
editing the 2da.

Each row in itemprops.2da has a one-to-one
correspondence with a row in itempropdef.2da.

The value under these columns is 1 if the property on the
row is available for the specified property column

Depending on the row within itemprops.2da, there may be
multiple additional columns after the Label column, with
no heading. This is a violation of the 2da formatting
convention where all rows have the same number of
columns and all columns have a header.

However, this violation of the rules does not matter,
because in this case, the Label column is known to always
be the last column, with no meaningful columns after it.

This is the only 2da where, if you wish to add columns,
you should insert them, not append them to the end. The
insertion should be immediately before the Label column.

5.7.3. Weapon Combat Sounds
The weaponsounds.2da file specifies what sounds play when weapons of specific types hit targets of
various material types. Each row refers to a weapon type. In baseitems.2da, the WeaponMatType
column value is an index into weaponsounds.2da. The non-label columns in weaponsounds.2da specify
the ResRefs of wave files to play when a weapon hits the material type named in the column.
Material type is determined by the appearance of the object being hit:
For creatures, the SOUNDAPPTYPE in appearance.2da indexes into appearancesndset.2da. If the
row in appearancesndset.2da has **** values, then the material type is determined by the armor worn
by the creature. The base AC of the creature's armor is an index into defaultacsounds.2da, where the
ArmorType string value serves as a column name in weaponsounds.2da by randomly appending a "0"
or a "1" to the end of it.
For placeables, the SoundAppType in placeables.2da indexes into placeableobjsnds.2da, in which the
ArmorType string value serves as a column name in weaponsounds.2da by randomly appending a "0"
or a "1" to the end of it.
