Common Game GFF Structures
1. Introduction
This document describes Structs and Lists that are frequently seen in files saved in the BioWare
Generic File Format. This document assumes that the reader is already familiar with the Generic File
Format document.
When describing a Struct in this document, the StructID is provided for completeness, although in some
cases, the StructID may vary depending on the List or Struct that contains the Struct being described.
Also, in most cases, the game and toolset do not actually check the StructID.
This document is intended to supplement the documentation for various GFF files (eg., IFO, ARE, etc.).
Consequently, it may not fully disclose the details of any given Struct. In those instances where a Struct
is not completely described, it is strongly recommended that an application should write it out to disk
exactly as it was read in originally, with no modifications. Modifying a Struct without a good
understanding of it can lead to corrupted modules and corrupted saved games.
2. Location Struct
A Location is a Struct that describes a location in a module.
Table 2: Fields in a Location Struct (StructID 1)
Label
Type
Description
Area
### DWORD

ObjectId of the area containing the location
OrientationX
OrientationY
OrientationZ
### FLOAT

(x,y,z) components of the direction vector in
which the location faces
PositionX
PositionY
PositionZ
### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of the location
3. VarTable List, Variable Struct
A VarTable is a GFF List containing Variable GFF Structs. It is a list of scripting variables and their
values.
Table 3.1: Fields in a Variable Struct (StructID 0)
Label
Type
Description
Name
CExoString
The name of the variable as set by the
SetGlobalInt(), SetGlobalString(), etc.
scripting functions, and retrieved by the
corresponding GetGlobal*() functions.
Type
### DWORD

Variable's data type
Value
Depends on Type
The value of the Variable
The actual data type of a Variable's 'Value' Field depends on the value of it's 'Type' Field. The table
below lists the type IDs and their associated data types.

5. EventQueue List, Event Struct
An EventQueue is a GFF List containing Event GFF Structs. The Fields in an Event are given in the
table below:
Table 5.1: Fields in an Event Struct (StructID 0xABCD)
Label
Type
Description
CallerId
### DWORD

Object Id of the actor object
Day
### DWORD

Game day the event should fire
EventData
Depends on EventId
Struct that depends on the EventId
EventId
### DWORD

ID of the Event type
ObjectId
### DWORD

Object ID the event is acting on
Time
### DWORD

Game time the event should fire
The EventData Field is a GFF Struct that depends on the value of the EventId Field. The table below
lists some EventId values and what Structs are associated with them. These Structs are saved using the
StructID specified in the table, rather than whatever StructIDs they may normally use. Some EventIds
do not save an EventData Struct at all.

6. ActionList List, Action Struct
Game object instances may have actions queued up at the time that the game is saved. Any such
instances will contain a number of Action objects in their ActionList Field. The table below describes
an Action Struct.

NumParams

Paramaters
List
List of Parameter Structs (StructID 1). See Table 6.2
This List is not present if NumParams == 0.
Note that the spelling of the "Paramaters" Field is not a typographical error. It really is spelled that
way. By the time someone noticed that the spelling of "parameters" was incorrect, there was too much
existing data to justify fixing the spelling.
The table below describes a Struct in the Parameter List.

7. Script Situation Struct and Substructs
A Script Situation is a very complicated structure that is used by the scripting virtual machine. Details
of this structure are provided in here, but it is highly recommended that if an application reads this
structure, then it should write it back out exactly as it was read in originally.
