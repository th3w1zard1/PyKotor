Trigger Format

1. Introduction
A Trigger is a set of vertices defining a region that players and creatures can interact with. Two
common types of Trigger are Area Transitions and Traps.
Triggers are stored in the game and toolset using BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF), and it is
assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with GFF.
Trigger objects can be blueprints or instances. Trigger blueprints are saved as GFF files having a UTT
extension and "UTT " as the FileType string in their header. Trigger instances are stored as Trigger
Structs within a module's GIT files.
2.Trigger Struct
The tables in this section describe the GFF Struct for a Trigger object. Some Fields are only present on
Instances and others only on Blueprints.
For List Fields, the tables indicate the StructID used by the List elements.
2.1 Common Trigger Fields
The Table below lists the Fields that are present in all Trigger Structs, regardless of where they are
found.
Some Fields only make sense if the Trigger is an Area Transition, while other Fields make sense only if
the Trigger is a Trap. See the Field desription for details.
Table 2.1: Fields in all Trigger Structs
Label
Type
Description
AutoRemoveKey

### BYTE

Not used.
Originally intended use: Property for Area Transition
Triggers.
1 = remove the key object from the player that uses this
Area Transition
0 = leave key on player after passing through the Area
Transition
Cursor

### BYTE

Index into cursors.2da.
Specifies a special mouse cursor icon to use when the
player mouses over the Trigger.
0 means there is no mouseover cursor feedback.

Game should use the specified cursor only if the
OnClick event is non-empty.

Area Transition triggers should always have the cursor
set to 1 by the toolset. For Area Transitions, the game
ignores the Cursor value anyway and always uses
Cursor 1.

See section below on cursors.2da.
DisarmDC

### BYTE

If the Trigger is a Trap (Type == 2), then this is the DC
to disarm the trap. Toolset enforces 1-250 range.
Faction

### DWORD

ID of the Faction that the Trigger belongs to. A Trap
Trigger will only go off for creatures that are hostile to
its Faction.
The Faction ID is the index of the Faction in the
module's Faction.fac file.
HighlightHeight

### FLOAT

Some Triggers have a highlight color ingame (Area
Transitions are blue, Traps are red, and clickable
generic triggers are green).
If the trigger highlights, this is the height in metres
above the ground that the highlight extends. Anything
within the Trigger boundaries will be lit by the trigger
highlight color up to this height.
KeyName
CExoString
Not used.
Originally intended use: If the Trigger is an Area
Transition, this is the Tag of an item that the
transitioning creature must be carrying in order to use
the Area Transition.
LinkedTo
CExoString
Tag of the object that this Area Transition links to.
LinkedToFlags

### BYTE

0 if the Trigger does not link to anything
1 if the Trigger is an Area Transition and links to a
Door.
2 if the Trigger is an Area Transition and links to a
Waypoint.
LoadScreenID

### WORD

Index into loadscreens.2da.
Specifies a loading screen to use when following this
Area Transition, if the transition causes the player to go
to a different area.
If LoadScreenID == 0, then use the default loading
screen as specified by the destination area.
See Section 2.3 in the Area GFF doc.

CExoLocString
Name of the trigger as it appears on the toolset's
Trigger palette and in the Name field of the toolset's
Trigger Properties dialog.
Does not appear in game.
OnClick

Toolset will allow the Cursor Field to be set.
OnDisarm
CResRef
OnDisarm event. Applies to Trap Triggers.
OnTrapTriggered
CResRef
OnTrapTriggered event
PortraitId

### WORD

Index into portraits.2da.

the instance was created from.
TrapDetectable

### BYTE

1 if Trap can be detected, 0 if not
TrapDetectDC

### BYTE

DC to detect the Trap. Toolset enforces 1-250 range.

TrapFlag

### BYTE

1 if the Trigger is a Trap, 0 if not
TrapOneShot

### BYTE

1 if the Trap disappears after firing, 0 otherwise
TrapType

### BYTE

Index into traps.2da.
Specifies the trap type, if the Trigger is a Trap.
See section below on traps.2da.
Type
INT
Trigger Type
0 = Generic
1 = Area Transition
2 = Trap
If the Type is 1 (Area Transition) then LinkedToFlags
must be greater than 0.
If the Type is 2 (Trap) then TrapFlag must also be 1.
2.2. Trigger Blueprint Fields
The Top-Level Struct in a UTW file contains all the Fields in Table 2.1 above, plus those in Table 2.2
below.

Label
Type
Description
Comment
CExoString
Module designer comment.
PaletteID

### BYTE

ID of the node that the Trigger Blueprint appears under
in the Trigger palette.
TemplateResRef
CResRef
The filename of the UTT file itself. It is an error if this
is different. Certain applications check the value of this
Field instead of the ResRef of the actual file.
If you manually rename a UTT file outside of the
toolset, then you must also update the TemplateResRef
Field inside it.
2.3. Trigger Instance Fields
A Trigger Instance Struct in a GIT file contains all the Fields in Table 2.1, plus those in Table 2.3.1
below.
Table 2.3.1: Fields in Trigger Instance Structs (Struct ID 1)
Label
Type
Description
Geometry
List
List of Point Structs (StructID 3) defining the vertices
of the Trigger polygon. See Table 2.3.2.
The polygon is drawn by starting at the first Point
element and drawing a line to each subsequent Point,
then connecting the last one back to the first.
See section 4 for additional rules governing the
Geometry of a Trigger.
TemplateResRef
CResRef
For instances, this is the ResRef of the blueprint that
the instance was created from.
XOrientation
YOrientation

### FLOAT

Orientation of the Trigger. The X and Y components
should both always be zero. If not, the Trigger may
render strangely and incorrectly in the toolset. The
game ignores the orientation.
XPosition
YPosition
ZPosition

### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of the Trigger within the Area that it
is located in.
The Points in the Trigger Geometry have their
coordinates specified relative to the Trigger's own

## Page 4

location.
Table 2.3.2: Fields in Point Struct (Struct ID 3)
Label
Type
Description
PointX
PointY
PointZ

### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of the Point, assuming that the
origin is at the owner Trigger's position.
The points in the Trigger's Geometry List use a coordinate system where the origin is the Trigger's own
position. For example, suppose that a Trigger has (XPosition, YPosition, ZPosition) = (10, 20, 30). If
the Geometry contains a Point at (PointX, PointY, PointZ) = (0, 0, 0), then the actual coordinates of
that Point are (10, 20, 30). Similarly, if there is another Point belonging to the same Trigger has
coordinates (PointX, PointY, PointZ) = (1, 2, -10), then the actual coordinates of that Point are (11, 22,
20).
There is no requirement that any Point in the List be at (0,0,0), nor is there any requirement against it.
2.4 Trigger Game Instance Fields
After a GIT file has been saved by the game, the Trigger Instance Struct not only contains the Fields in
Table 2.1 and Table 2.3.1, it also contains the Fields in Table 2.4.
INVALID_OBJECT_ID is a special constant equal to 0x7f000000 in hex.

Structs document.
CreatorId

### DWORD

Object ID of the Trigger's creator.
For Traps set by a player, this is the player's Object ID.
For Triggers painted in the toolset and loaded by the
game, this is equal to the INVALID_OBJECT_ID
constant.
ObjectId

### DWORD

Object ID used by game for this object.

3. The 2DA Files Referenced by Trigger Fields
3.1. Cursor
In a Trigger Struct, the Cursor Field is an index into cursors.2da.
Cursors.2da is used mainly by the toolset in order to obtain a list of cursors that can be assigned to
Triggers. The game maintains its own,much larger, internal list of cursors.

4. Geometry Rules for the Point List
In a Trigger instance, the Geometry List contains the points that define the outline of the Trigger.
The toolset must enforce several rules for polygon geometry, as given below. Note that the "Single
Inner Surface" and "No Crossing Lines" rules below apply to just the x and y coordinates of the points
in the Geometry List, with the z coordinates ignored.
4.1. Minimum number of Points
There must be a minimum of three Points in the Geometry List to ensure that the polygon actually has
a visible area.
4.2. Single Inner Surface
There must be only one "inside" surface.
For example, a figure-8 as shown in Figure 4.2a is illegal, and will be reduced to being just the upper
portion or the lower portion, as shown in Figure 4.2b. The numbers in Figure 4.2a indicate the order in
which the user painted the vertices, while the numbers in Figure 4.2b indicate the order of the vertices
after the toolset's geometry conversion.

4.3. No Crossing Lines
None of the lines connecting the Points should cross.
For example, suppose the user draws a 5-vertex pentragram as shown in Figure 4.3a. The numbers in
the figure indicate the order in which the user painted the vertices.

The toolset would convert the geometry so that it becomes a 5-pointed star consisting of 10 vertices
and one contiguous inside area uncrossed by any lines, as shown in Figure 4.3b. The numbers in the
figure indicate the order of the vertices after the toolset's geometry conversion.

Although lines may not cross, it is permissible for two points to share the exact same location, such as
points 0 and 3 in Figure 4.3c. None of the lines in Figure 4.3c are considered to cross, even though the

## Page 11

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
endpoints of four lines do touch. It is, however, next to impossible in the toolset for a user to actually
paint a figure where two points are exactly coincident as in 4.3c, so this special case is more of a
curiosity than anything else.

4.4. Leftmost Point First
As a matter of convention, the Point having the smallest x-coordinate is used as the first point in the
Point List. If more than one Point is tied for having the smallest x-coordinate, then the first such point
that was drawn by the user is the one that is used. Figure 4.3b shows the application of this rule to the
figure show in Figure 4.3a.
This rule is not required, in that if the points were in a different order, the toolset and game would still
load the polygon correctly and without errors.
