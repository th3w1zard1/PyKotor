Generic File Format (GFF)

1. Introduction
The Generic File Format (GFF) is an all-purpose generic format used to store data in BioWare games. It
is designed to make it easy to add or remove fields and data structures while still maintaining backward
and forward compatibility in reading old or new versions of a file format.
The backward and forward compatibility of GFF was important to the development of BioWare's games
because file formats changed rapidly. For example, if a designer needed creatures in the game to have a
new property to store their Last Name, it was easy to add that field to the creature file format. New
versions of the game and tools would write out the new field, and old versions would just ignore it.
In Neverwinter Nights, a BioWare game, most of the non-plain-text data contained in a module is in
GFF, although the compiled scripts are a notable exception.
The following file types within a module are all in GFF:
•
Module info file (ifo)
•
Area-related files: area file (are), game object instances and dynamic area properties (git),
game instance comments (gic)
•
Object Blueprints: creature (utc), door (utd), encounter (ute), item (uti), placeable (utp), sound
(uts), store (utm), trigger (utt), waypoint (utw)
•
Conversation files (dlg)
•
Journal file (jrl)
•
Faction file (fac)
•
Palette file (itp)
•
Plot Wizard files: plot instance/plot manager file (ptm), plot wizard blueprint (ptt)
The following files created by the game are also GFF:
•
Character/Creature File (bic)
2. File Format Conceptual Overview
2.1. General Description
A GFF file represents a collection of data. C programmers can think of this collection as a struct.
Pascal programmers can think of it as a record. Each item (properly called a Field) of data has: a text
Label , a data type, and a value. C programmers can think of Fields as member variables in a C struct.
The labelling of Fields is the key to GFF being able to maintain backward and forward compatibility
between different file formats.
The above concepts are best illustrated by an example.
Example of GFF usage
Let us use a simplified example of a Waypoint object. A Waypoint has a Tag that is used for
scripting purposes, and it has a location. In C++ code, a Waypoint might be defined as follows:
class TWaypoint
{
TString m_sTag;

## Page 2

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
float m_fPositionX;
float m_fPositionY;
float m_fPositionZ;
};
(Notes: In the above declaration, we have purposefully omitted member function declarations
because they are irrelevant to this example. Also, assume that a string class called TString has
already been defined)
Suppose we have an instance of a Waypoint tagged "ShopEntrance", located at (3.2, 5.7, 0.0) in
some Area.
When saved to GFF, it would "look" like this:
"Tag"        string  "ShopEntrance"
"PositionX"  float   3.200
"PositionY"  float   5.700
"PositionZ"  float   0.000
Now suppose we decide to add a MapNote property, which is a string that appears when the
player mouses over a Waypoint in the game's minimap, and a HasMapNote property to specify
whether the Waypoint appears on the minimap in the first place. The C++ declaration for the
Waypoint object might now be:
class TWaypoint
{
TString m_sTag;

bool m_bHasMapNote;      // this was added
TString m_sMapNoteText;  // this was added

float m_fPositionX;
float m_fPositionY;
float m_fPositionZ;
};
If we try to load our old Waypoint instance from before, the program would still correctly load
the Tag and X, Y, Z coordinates because it reads them from the GFF file by finding their Labels
and reading the associated data. The fact that we just inserted some extra data inbetween the Tag
and coordinates is inconsequential. Reading Fields from a GFF file does not depend at all on the
physical position of Fields' bytes relative to each other within the file.
In this example, it is a simple matter from a programming perspective to notice that the old
Waypoint instance does not have a MapNoteText or HasMapNote property stored on it in the
GFF file. On seeing this, it is equally simple to set default values for those properties if their
GFF Fields were not found.
2.2. Field Data Types
Allowed GFF Field types are listed in the table below.

Struct
variable
A complex data type that can contain any number of
any of the other data types, including other Structs.
List
variable
A list of Structs.
A few of these data types merit additional explanation.
Void data
The Void type is used to store a stream of raw bytes as a single item of data under a single label.
Possible applications include storage of raw image or sound data. It is never a good idea to use
the void type to directly dump a data structure (such as a user-defined C struct) from memory to
disk. The other primitive data types should be used to store each structure element instead.
CExoString
The CExoString type is a simple character string.
The suggested maximum allowed length is 1024 characters, which is a limit defined primarily to
conserve network bandwidth in the case of strings that need to be passed from server to game
client.
CExoStrings are generally not used for text that the player might see, since it would be the same
text regardless of the player's native language. Instead, CExoStrings are used largely for
developer/designer-only text, such as Tags used in scripting.
CExoLocString
A CExoLocString is a string type used to store text that may appear to the user and has a number
of features designed to allow users to see text in their own language.

1) StringRef: A CExoLocString always contains at least a single integer called a StringRef (or
StrRef). A StrRef is an index into the user's dialog.tlk file, which contains text that has been
localized for the user's language.
2) Embedded Strings with Language IDs: If the StrRef is -1, then dialog.tlk is not used, and
instead, the localized text must be embedded within the CExoLocString. A CExoLocString may
contain zero or more normal strings, each paired with a language ID that identifies what
language the string should be displayed for.

## Page 4

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
In the presence of both embedded strings and a valid StringRef, the behaviour is up to the
application. In the toolset, embedded strings take precedence, assuming that there is an
embedded string for the user's language. As with CExoStrings, embedded strings in
CExoLocStrings should be no more than 1024 characters.
The following is a list of languages and their IDs:

Spanish

Japanese

3) Gender: In addition to specifying a string by Language ID, substrings in a LocString have a
gender associated with them. 0 = neutral or masculine; 1 = feminine. In some languages, the text
that should appear would vary depending on the gender of the player, and this flag allows the
application to choose an appropriate string.
The Struct Data Type
In addition to the primitive data types listed above, GFF has a compound data type called a
Struct. A Struct can contain any number of data Fields. Each Field can be any one of the above
listed Field types, including a Struct or List.
Regardless of what Fields are packed into a Struct, there is always a single integer value
associated with the Struct, which is the Struct ID. This ID is defined by the programmer who is
writing out GFF data, and can be used to identify a Struct without having to check what Fields it
contains. In many cases, though, the programmer already knows--or can assume--the Struct
structure simply by the context in which the Struct was found, in which case the ID is
unimportant.
Every GFF file contains at least one Struct at the top level of the file, containing all the other
data in the file. The Top-Level Struct does not have a LabelThe Top-Level Struct has a Struct ID
of 0xFFFFFFFF in hex.
The List Data Type
A List is simply a list of Structs. Like all GFF Fields, a List has a Label.
Structs that are elements of a List do not have Labels.
2.3. Field Labels
Every Field has a Label, a text string that identifies it. This Label can have up to 16 characters.
When a program writes out a structure in memory to disk as a GFF file, each field in that memory
structure is written out using the most appropriate GFF Field data type, and with a GFF Label
associated with it.
It is this labelling of data elements that makes GFF useful for storing data structures that are subject to
change. When new  information is added to a data structure, old GFF files can still be read because the

## Page 5

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
old data is fetched by Label rather than by offset. That is, no assumptions are made as to where one
variable is relative to another in the file.
3. File Format Physical Layout
This section describes what the actual bytes are in a GFF file, where they are, and what they do.
The file format descriptions in this section use the following terminology:
•
BYTE: 1-byte (8-bit) unsigned integer
•
CHAR: 1-byte (8-bit) character
•
DWORD: 4-byte (32-bit) unsigned integer
Note that GFF byte order is little endian, which is the format used by Intel processors. If an integer
value is more than 1 byte long, then the least significant byte is the first one, and the most significant
byte is the last one. For example, the number 258 (0x0102 in hex) expressed as a 4-byte integer would
be stored as the following sequence of bytes within the file: 0x02, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00.
3.1. Overall File Layout
A GFF file contains 7 distinct sections--1 fixed-size header, 5 arrays of fixed-size elements, and 1 block
of raw data. The offset to each section is stored in the header, as is the number of elements in each
array.

BioWare Corp.

3.2. Header
The GFF header contains a number of values, all of them DWORDs (32-bit unsigned integers). The
header contains offset information for all the other sections in the GFF file. Values in the header are as
follows, and arranged in the order listed:
Table 3.2: Header Format
Value
Description
FileType
4-char file type string
FileVersion
4-char GFF Version. At the time of writing, the version is "V3.2"
StructOffset
Offset of Struct array as bytes from the beginning of the file
StructCount
Number of elements in Struct array
FieldOffset
Offset of Field array as bytes from the beginning of the file
FieldCount
Number of elements in Field array
LabelOffset
Offset of Label array as bytes from the beginning of the file
LabelCount
Number of elements in Label array
FieldDataOffset
Offset of Field Data as bytes from the beginning of the file
FieldDataCount
Number of bytes in Field Data block
FieldIndicesOffset
Offset of Field Indices array as bytes from the beginning of the file
FieldIndicesCount
Number of bytes in Field Indices array
ListIndicesOffset
Offset of List Indices array as bytes from the beginning of the file
ListIndicesCount
Number of bytes in List Indices array
The FileVersion should always be "V3.2" for all GFF files that use the Generic File Format as
described in this document. If the FileVersion is different, then the application should abort reading the
GFF file.
The FileType is a programmer-defined 4-byte character string that identifies the content-type of the
GFF file. By convention, it is a 3-letter file extension in all-caps, followed by a space. For example,
"DLG ", "ITP ", etc. When opening a GFF file, the application should check the FileType to make
sure that the file being opened is of the expected type.
3.3. Structs
In a GFF file, Struct Fields are stored differently from other fields. Whereas most Fields are stored in
the Field array, Structs are stored in the Struct Array.
The very first element in the Struct Array is the Top-Level Struct for the GFF file, and it "contains" all
the other Fields, Structs, and Lists. In this sense, the word "contain" refers to conceptual containment
(as in Section 2.1) rather than physical containment (as in Section 3). In other words, it does not imply
that all the other Fields are physically located inside the Top-Level Struct on disk (in fact, all Structs
have the same physical size on disk).
Since the Top-Level Struct is always present, every GFF file contains at least one element in the Struct
Array.
The Struct Array looks like this:

## Page 7

Figure 3.3: Struct Array
Struct 0 (Top-Level Struct)
. . .
Struct 1
Struct N - 1
Struct 2
N = Header.StructCount
N is always greater than or equal to 1
Struct 0 is always present

Physically, a GFF Struct contains the values listed in the table below. All of them are DWORDs.
Table 3.3: Struct Format
Value
Description
Struct.Type
Programmer-defined integer ID.
Struct.DataOrDataOffset
If Struct.FieldCount = 1, this is an index into the Field Array.
If Struct.FieldCount > 1, this is a byte offset into the Field Indices
array, where there is an array of DWORDs having a number of
elements equal to Struct.FieldCount. Each one of these DWORDs
is an index into the Field Array.
Struct.FieldCount
Number of fields in this Struct.
The above table shows that the Fields that a Struct conceptually contains are referenced indirectly via
the DataOrDataOffset value.
Struct 0, which is the Top-Level Struct, always has a Type (aka Struct ID) of 0xFFFFFFFF.
3.4. Fields
The Field Array contains all the Fields in the GFF file except for the Top-Level Struct.
Figure 3.4: Field Array

Each Field contains the values listed in the table below. All of the values are DWORDs.

If Field.Type is a simple data type (see table below), then this is
the value actual of the field.
If Field.Type is a complex data type (see table below), then this is
a byte offset into the Field Data block.
The Field Type specifies what data type the Field stores (recall the data types from Section 2.2). The
following table lists the values for each Field type. A datatype is considered complex if it would not fit
within a DWORD (4 bytes).

Non-complex Field data is contained directly within the Field itself, in the DataOrDataOffset member.
If the data type is smaller than a DWORD, then the first bytes of the DataOrDataOffset DWORD, up to
the size of the data type itself, contain the data value.
If the Field data is complex, then the DataOrDataOffset value is equal to a byte offset from the
beginning of the Field Data Block, pointing to the raw bytes that represent the complex data. The exact
method of fetching the complex data depends on the actual Field Type, and is described in Section 4.
*As a special case, if the Field Type is a Struct, then DataOrDataOffset is an index into the Struct Array
instead of a byte offset into the Field Data Block.
**As another special case, if the Field Type is a List, then DataOrDataOffset is a byte offset from the
beginning of the List Indices Array, where there is a DWORD for the size of the array followed by an
array of DWORDs.  The elements of the array are offsets into the Struct Array. See Section 4.9 for
details.
3.5. Labels
A Label is a 16-CHAR array. Unused characters are nulls, but the label itself is non-null-terminated, so
a 16-character label would use up all 16 CHARs with no null at the end.
The Label Array is a list of all the Labels used in a GFF file.
Note that a single Label may be referenced by more than one Field. When multiple Fields have Labels
with the exact same text, they share the same Label element instead of each having their own copy. This

## Page 9

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
sharing occurs regardless of what Struct the Field belongs to. All Labels in the Label Array should be
unique.
Also, the Fields belonging to a Struct must all use different Labels. It is permissible, however, for Fields
in two different Structs to use the same Label, regardless of whether one of those Structs is conceptually
contained inside the other Struct.
Figure 3.5: Label Array
Label 0
. . .
Label 1
Label N - 1
Label 2
N = Header.LabelCount

3.6. Field Data Block
The Field Data block contains raw data for any Fields that have a complex Field Type, as described in
Section 3.4. The two exceptions to this rule are Struct and List Fields, which are not stored in the Field
Data Block.
The FieldDataCount in the GFF header specifies the number of BYTEs contained in the Field Data
block.
The data in the Field Data Block is laid out according to the type of Field that owns each byte of data.
See Section 4 for details.
3.7. Field Indices
A Field Index is a DWORD containing the index of the associated Field within the Field array.
The Field Indices Array is an array of such DWORDs.
3.8. List Indices
The List Indices Array contains a sequence of List elements packed end-to-end.
A List is an array of Structs, and being array, its length is variable. The format of a List is as shown
below:

## Page 10

Size (DWORD)
. . .
Index 0
Index N - 1
Index 1

Index 2
Indices into Struct Array (1 DWORD each)

The first DWORD is the Size of the List, and it specifies how many Struct elements the List contains.
There are Size DWORDS after that, each one an index into the Struct Array.
4.  Complex Field Data: Descriptions and Physical Format
This section describes the byte-by-byte makeup of each of the complex Field types' data, as they are
stored in the Field Data Block.

### 4.1. DWORD64

A DWORD64 is a 64-bit (8-byte) unsigned integer. As with all integer values in GFF, the least
significant byte comes first, and the most significant byte is last.

### 4.2. INT64

An INT64 is a 64-bit (8-byte) signed integer. As with all integer values in GFF, the least significant
byte comes first, and the most significant byte is last.

### 4.3. DOUBLE

A DOUBLE is a double-precision floating point value, and takes up 8 bytes. It is stored in little-endian
byte order, with the least significant byte first.
(Both the FLOAT and DOUBLE data types conform to IEEE Standard 754-1985).
4.4. CExoString
A CExoString is a simple character string datatype. The figure below shows the layout of a CExoString:

## Page 11

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
Figure 4.4: CExoString Format
Size
(4 bytes long)
. . .
char 0 (1 byte)
char N - 1
char 1 (1 byte)
N = value contained in Size
char 2
characters in string (1 byte each)

A CExoString begins with a single DWORD (4-byte unsigned integer) which stores the string's Size. It
specifies how many characters are in the string. This character-count does not include a null terminator.
If we let N equal the number stored in Size, then the next N bytes after the Size are the characters that
make up the string. There is no null terminator.
Example: The string "Test" would consist of the following byte sequence:
0x04 0x00 0x00 0x00 'T' 'e' 's' 't'
4.5. CResRef
A CResRef is used to store the name of a file used by the game or toolset. These files may be located in
the BIF files in the user's data folder, inside an Encapsulated Resource File (ERF, MOD, or HAK), or in
the user's override folder. For efficiency and to reduce network bandwidth, A ResRef can only have up
to 16 characters and is not null-terminated. ResRefs are also non-case-sensitive and stored in all-lower-
case.
The diagram below shows the structure of a CResRef stored in a GFF:
Figure 4.5: CResRef Format
Size (1 byte)
. . .
char 0
char N - 1
char 1
N = value contained in Size, 16 at most
char 2
characters in string (1 byte each)

The first byte is a Size, an unsigned value specifying the number of characters to follow. The Size is 16
at most. The character string contains no null terminator.

## Page 12

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
4.6. CExoLocString
A CExoLocString is a localized string. It can contain 0 or more CExoStrings, each one for a different
language and possibly gender. For a list of language IDs, see Table 2.2b.
The figure below shows the layout of a CExoLocString.
Figure 4.6a: CExoLocString Format
Total Size
(4-byte DWORD)
StringRef
(4-byte DWORD)
StringCount
(4-byte DWORD)
SubString 0
SubString 1
SubString N - 1
. . .
N = value contained in StringCount

A CExoLocString begins with a single DWORD (4-byte unsigned integer) which stores the total
number of bytes in the CExoLocString, not including the first 4 size bytes.
The next 4 bytes are a DWORD containing the StringRef of the LocString. The StringRef is an index
into the user's dialog.tlk file, which contains a list of almost all the localized text in the game and
toolset. If the StringRef is -1 (ie., 0xFFFFFFFF), then the LocString does not reference dialog.tlk at all.
The 4 bytes after the StringRef comprise the StringCount, a DWORD that specifies how many
SubStrings the LocString contains. The remainder of the LocString is a list of SubStrings.
A LocString SubString has almost the same format as a CExoString, but includes an additional String
ID at the beginning.

## Page 13

char N - 1
char 1

char 2
StringLength

StringID

characters in string (1 byte each)

The StringID stored in a GFF file does not match up exactly to the LanguageIDs shown in Table 2.2b.
Instead, it is 2 times the Language ID, plus the Gender (0 for neutral or masculine, 1 for feminine).
If we let N equal the number stored in StringLength, then the N bytes after the StringLength are the
characters that make up the string. There is no null terminator.
4.7. Void/binary
Void data is an arbitrary sequence of bytes to be interpreted by the application in a programmer-defined
fashion. The format is shown below:

## Page 14

BioWare Corp.
<http://www.bioware.com>
Figure 4.7: Void Format
Size
(4 byte

### DWORD)

. . .
byte 0
byte N - 1
byte 1
N = value contained in Size
byte 2
data bytes

Size is a DWORD containing the number of bytes of data. The data itself is contained in the N bytes
that follow, where N is equal to the Size value.
4.8. Struct
Unlike most of the complex Field data types, a Struct Field's data is located not in the Field Data Block,
but in the Struct Array.
Normally, a Field's DataOrDataOffset value would be a byte offset into the Field Data Block, but for a
Struct, it is an index into the Struct Array.
For information on the layout of a Struct, see Section 3.3, with particular attention to Table 3.3.
4.9. List
Unlike most of the complex Field data types, a List Field's data is located not in the Field Data Block,
but in the Field Indices Array.
The starting address of a List is specified in its Field's DataOrDataOffset value as a byte offset into the
Field Indices Array, at which is located a List element. Section 3.8 describes the structure a List
element.
