Situated Object (Door and Placeable Object) Format

1. Introduction
A Situated Object is a base object type from which the Door and Placeable Object types are derived.
Situated objects contain all the shared properties of Doors and Placeable objects. This document will
first discuss these shared properties, then discuss the properties that are specific to doors and placeable
objects themselves.
A Door is an object type that serves several functions. When closed, it blocks movement of creatures,
and may block line of sight. Additionally, doors may serve as an area transition targets and trap
locations.
A Placeable Object is an object type that adds to the ambience of an area, beyond the level provided by
the tiles in the area's tileset. They may be purely decorational and inactive, or they may be set to be
useable by players, whether as operable switches, as containers, or as traps.
Doors and Placeable objects are stored in the game and toolset using BioWare's Generic File Format
(GFF), and it is assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with GFF.
Doors and Placeable objects can be blueprints or instances. Door blueprints are saved as GFF files
having a UTD extension and "UTD " as the FileType string in their header. Door instances are stored as
Door Structs within a module's GIT files. Similarly, Placeable object blueprints are UTP files with
"UTP " as their FileType string, and Placeable instances are Placeable Structs within a module's GIT
files.
2. Base Situated Object Struct
The tables in this section describe the GFF Struct for a basic Situated object. All Doors and Placeables
share the properties of a Situated object.
2.1 Common Situated Fields
The Table below lists the Fields that are present in all Situated Structs, regardless of where they are
found.

3.2. Door Blueprint Struct
Door Blueprints contain the Fields listed in Tables 2.1, 2.2, and 3.1.
3.3. Door Instance Struct
3.3.1. Door Instance Fields
Door Instances placed in the toolset contain the Fields listed in Tables 2.1, 2.3, and 3.1.
3.3.2. Relation of Door Instance Models to Appearance and GenericType
The appearance of a door instance is determined by where the door is located on a tile. Doors instances
can only be painted at a location that corresponds to a door hook point on a tile. The hook point
specifies the location and orientation at which a door can be placed, and it also places restrictions on
what model the door can have when placed there.
Hook points on a tile are determined by both the tileset .SET file and the actual model .MDL file for the
tile. It is an error if the SET file and MDL files do not agree, although the toolset itself does not check
for consistency. It only looks at the SET file information. BioWare's BuildTil utility however, enforces
consistency between the SET file and the MDL file, modifying the SET file if necessary to make it
consistent with the MDL file.
There are two types of hook point: Unique (aka. Tileset-specific) and Generic.
Unique door hookpoints are attached to tiles that contain doorway geometry that demands a door of a
specific appearance. The SET file entry for a Unique door hookpoint contains an index into
doortypes.2da. Any door instance painted or moved onto a Unique hookpoint will be modified to have
its Appearance match the one implied by the hookpoint.
Generic door hookpoints are attached to tiles that contain a generic doorway that can fit a variety of
door appearances. The SET file entry for a Generic door hookpoint contains an index into
genericdoors.2da. Any door instance painted or moved onto a Generic hookpoint will be modified to
have Appearance 0, and its model will then be determined by its GenericType.
If a door is moved from a Generic hookpoint to a Unique hookpoint, its Appearance changes, but its
GenericType remains the same, so that when moved back to a Generic hookpoint, it will once again
have the model that it had before.
3.4. Door Game Instance Fields
After a GIT file has been saved by the game, the Door Instance Struct contains the Fields in Tables 2.1,
2.3, 2.4, 3.1, and 4.4.

Static

### BYTE

1 if the Placeable is static.
0 if the Placeable is nonstatic.

Static objects are loaded client-side and are
inaccessible through scripting because the server
forgets about them after telling the client where they
are located and what they look like. They cannot be
interacted with in any way by the players or creatures
in a game, and they cannot have any animation state
other than the default.

Make objects Static to improve client and server
performance, and if they are present only for
decoration.

### BYTE

Obsolete. Not used. Always 0.
Useable

### BYTE

1 if the Placeable can be used by a player.
The AnimationState of a placeable object specifies what animations it should play. Table 4.1.2 lists the
possible animation states. Not all animation states are available for all Placeable objects. A particular
animation state is only available if the model (MDL) file for its appearance actually contains an
animation of the name specified in Table 4.1.2.
