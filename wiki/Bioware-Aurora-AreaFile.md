BioWare Aurora Engine
Area File (ARE, GIT, GIC) Formats
1. Introduction
In the BioWare Aurora engine, each Area in a module is described by three files. Each file has the same
filename, but a different extension. The following are brief summaries of the area file types.
ARE - static area information: area properties and tile layout.
GIT - dynamic area information - game object instances and sound properties.
GIC - area comments - contains toolset-only comments on game object instances.
The file type are in BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF) and it is assumed that the reader has some
familiarity with GFF.
Conventions
This document describes the GFF structures used by the various area files, as well as any 2DA files that
are referenced by Fields in those GFF files.
For GFF List Fields, the tables indicate the StructID used by the List elements.
Certain numerical GFF Fields have a range of allowable values, and any application that sets these
values should respect the range limitations because there are no guarantees regarding how the game or
toolset treats invalid values.
2. ARE Format
An ARE file contains static information about an Area. The Area properties that are stored in an ARE
file cannot be modified via scripting.
Savegame (.SAV) files are ERFs that contain all the contents of the module, but with modifications and
additions to the some of the original GFF files in the module. The ARE files are not one of the modified
files, though. If the savegame file is for a module having the .nwm extension (from the nwm folder),
then the ARE files are not even included in the savegame. When a nwm-saved game is reloaded, the
game reads the ARE files from the original NWM. For all other saved games, it reads the ARE files
from the SAV file.
2.1. ARE Top Level Struct
In the GFF header of an ARE file, the FileType value is "ARE ".

measured in number of tiles
WindPower
INT
Strength of the wind in the area. None, weak, or strong
(0-2).
Some of the color values in the above table are in BGR format. The bytes within a BGR DWORD
value are arranged as 0BGR, where the 0 indicates that the first byte is 0x00. Since GFF integer data is
stored on disk in little-endian/Intel byte ordering, with the least significant byte first, the bytes on disk
will actually appear in the order R G B 0.
2.2. Environment and LightingScheme
The LightingScheme Field is an index into Environment.2da, which contains a list of preset visual area
properties. When a user initially selects one of the lighting schemes in the toolset, it automatically sets
default values for all the area properties that correspond to columns in environment.2da.
The user's choice of environment scheme is stored with the LightingScheme ARE Field, but has no
further effect on any other area property beyond what they were initially set to on first choosing the
lighting scheme. At any time, the user can manually edit the visual area properties and the edited
values will be the ones that are saved.

2.5. Area Tile List
The Tile_List Field is a list of the AreaTiles in the area. An AreaTile describes what tile is located at a
given position in the area, how it is oriented, and what graphical effects exist on it.
To determine the x-y grid coordinates of a tile, use the following formulae:
x = i % w
y = i / w
where:
i = index of the AreaTile Struct in Tile_List
w = the value stored in the area's Width Field
% = modulus operator, ie., the remainder after the left-hand side by the right-hand side
/ = integer division, with result round down to nearest integer
The Fields in an AreaTile are given in the table below:
Table 2.5a: Fields in AreaTile Struct (StructID 1)
Label
Type
Description
Tile_AnimLoop1
Tile_AnimLoop2
Tile_AnimLoop3
INT
Boolean values to indicate if the "AnimLoop01",
"AnimLoop02", or "AnimLoop03" animations on the
tile model should play (1) or not (0).
An AnimLoop can only be set if the correspondingly
named animation actually exists on the tile model.
Otherwise, the Field value is 0.
Tile_Height
INT
Number of height transitions that this tile is located at.
Should never be negative.
Tile_ID
INT
Index into the tileset file's list of tiles, to specify what
tile to use
Tile_MainLight1
Tile_MainLight2
### BYTE

Index into lightcolor.2da to specify mainlight color on
the tile. A tile can have up to 2 mainlights. If a
mainlight does not exist on a tile or is off, the Field
value is 0.
Tile_Orientation INT
Orientation of tile model.
0 = normal orientation
1 = 90 degrees counterclockwise
2 = 180 degrees counterclockwise
3 = 270 degrees counterclockwise
Tile_SrcLight1
Tile_SrcLight2
### BYTE

0 if SourceLight is off or does not exist.
1-15 to specify color and animation of sourcelight.
See "Source Lights" section below for more details.

Some of the Fields in the AreaTile Struct are indices into lightcolor.2da, which is given below.
Table 2.5b: lightcolor.2da columns
Column
Type
Description
RED
### GREEN

### BLUE

Float
RGB colors (0.00 to 2.00).
### LABEL

String
Programmer label
### TOOLSETRED

### TOOLSETBLUE

### TOOLSETGREEN

Float
RGB colors (0.00 to 1.00).
Used by toolset to display a color in the Color Selection dialog
that appears when clicking a color square in the Tile Properties
dialog.
Main Lights
A mainlight is an overall colored lighting effect that can be applied to a tile.
To determine if a tile has a mainlight, the application must inspect its model file. There should be a
light node whose name is the tile model's ResRef in all-caps with "ml1" or "ml2" appended to the end.
For example, if the tile model is tts_a01_01.mdl, then mainlight 1 on that tile would be a light
node called "TTZ_A01_01ml1".
If a light node does not exist, then the toolset does disables the controls to set the light's value.
Source Lights
A sourcelight is a point on a tile where the graphics engine can attach the model of a flaming light
source.
Not all tiles have sourcelights. To determine if a sourcelight is present, the application must inspect the
tile's model file. There should be a dummy node whose name is the tile model's ResRef in all-caps with
"sl1" or "sl2" appended to the end.
To create a sourcelight in the graphics engine, spawn "fx_flame01.mdl" at the position of the tile's
"sl1" or "sl2" dummy node and play the animation whose name matches the value of the appropriate
Tile_SrcLight Field.
Example: if the tile model as specified by the TileSet and Tile_ID is ttz_a01_01.mdl, and
Tile_SrcLight2 is 14, then spawn fx_flame01.mdl at the "TTZ_A01_01sl2" dummy node
in the tile and set it to play the animation named "14".
To get a rough visual representation of the source light color associated with a given number, take the
Tile_SrcLight value, multiply it by 2, and use it as an index into lightcolor.2da, which contains the
RGB values. Note however, that editing lightcolor.2da will have no effect on the colors shown in the
graphics engine; the colors are entirely determined by the animations embedded in fx_flame01.mdl. In
other words, lightcolor.2da should match up with the model, not the other way around.
3. GIT Format
A GIT file contains dynamic information about an area. The main purpose of a GIT is to store lists of
all the object instances in the area, but it is also used to store a few area properties that can be changed
via scripting. When a game is saved, the game includes an updated version of the GIT file for each area
in the .SAV file.
In the GFF header of a GIT file, the FileType value is "GIT ".

SaveGame GIT properties
When a game is saved, a GIT file for every area in the module is saved into the .SAV file. The
savegame GIT serves the same purpose as the GIT created by the toolset, although of course, the
contents of its object lists may differ significantly, and the AreaProperties Struct may have different
Field values.
The game also saves some additional fields to the Toplevel GIT Struct, as given below:

Type
Description
AreaEffectList
List
List of AreaEffects.
StructID 13.
CurrentWeather
### BYTE

0 = Clear
1 = Rain
2 = Snow
VarTable
List
List of variables stored on area.
StructID 0. See Section 3 of the Common GFF
Structs document.
WeatherStarted
### BYTE

1 if weather specified by CurrentWeather is starting, 0
otherwise.
4. GIC Format
The GIC file is used purely to store the Comment properties of all the object instances in the area.
The game does not read or use the toolset-saved Comments in any fashion, so including them in the
GIT file with the rest of the object instance information would unnecessarily increase the size of
SaveGame files (recall that SaveGame ERFs contain GIT files for each area).
There is a one-to-one correspondence between list elements in the GIC file and those in the GIT file for
the same area. Note that Table 4.1 below and Table 3.1 above contain identically named lists.
In the GFF header of a GIC file, the FileType value is "GIC ".
