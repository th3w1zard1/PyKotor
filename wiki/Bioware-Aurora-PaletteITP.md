ITP (Palette) File Format
1. Introduction
An ITP file defines a palette used by the toolset or DM Client. A palette describes a tree structure of
tiles or object blueprints that can be painted in the toolset, or object blueprints that can be spawned in
the DM Client.
Palettes are stored in the game and toolset using BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF), and it is
assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with the Generic File Format document.
In the GFF header of an ITP file, the FileType value is "ITP ".
2. Blueprint Palettes
2.1. Overview
Blueprint palettes appear in the many treeviews in the toolset that contain paintable object blueprints.
They also appear in treeviews where the user can pick a palette category for an object, such as in the
"Assign Palette Category" step of the various New Blueprint wizards or in the Select Category dialog.
These palette treeviews contain 3 node types:
Blueprint Nodes:
A Blueprint Node is a node that is directly associated with an object blueprint.
Clicking on a blueprint node in the toolset allows the user to paint instances of the associated
Blueprint. Clicking on a Blueprint node in the DM client allows the user to spawn in instances of the
blueprint.
In the toolset, the user can right-click a Blueprint node to perform various maintenance tasks such as
editing it.
A palette can have zero or more Blueprint nodes. The Standard blueprint palettes generally contain
many Blueprint nodes. The Custom blueprint palettes in a new module contain zero blueprint nodes.
Blueprint nodes never have child nodes.
Non-Blueprint Nodes:
Non-blueprint nodes can have child nodes that may be blueprint nodes, or they may be other non-
blueprint nodes. They are not editable in the toolset and they define the overall structure of a palette.
Category Nodes:
A Category Node serves as a parent node for blueprint nodes and can only have blueprint nodes
as children.

When assigning a palette category to a blueprint in the toolset's Select Category dialog, the user
can only select Category nodes.
Branch Nodes:
A Branch Node serves as a parent node for Category nodes or other Branch nodes, but never
Blueprint nodes.
2.2. Skeleton Blueprint Palettes
A skeleton blueprint palette is a blueprint palette that contains no blueprint nodes, but merely defines
the categories and tree structure of a palette. There is one skeleton palette for each blueprint resource
type. The toolset recognizes the following skeleton blueprint palettes:
creaturepal.itp
doorpal.itp
encounterpal.itp
itempal.itp
placeablepal.itp
soundpal.itp
storepal.itp
triggerpal.itp
waypointpal.itp
The toolset uses skeleton blueprint palettes in the "Assign Palette Category" step of the various New
Blueprint wizards and in the Select Category dialog when choosing the palette category while editing
an object blueprint.
Figure 2.2 shows an example skeleton blueprint palette.

The toolset does not edit skeleton palettes. They are edited by hand using the GFF Editor. Because they
are hand-edited, they contain some GFF Fields that exist primarily to make editing easier, and which
have no actual effect in the toolset.

The node only appears:
1) in a custom blueprint palette,
2) in the skeleton palette that is displayed
when creating a new blueprint or
3) in the skeleton palette when choosing the
palette category for a custom blueprint.
2.3. Standard Blueprint Palettes
A standard blueprint palette is a palette that contains blueprint nodes for all the blueprints that exist
in the global game resources. That is, resources that exist in the BIF files and in Override. There is one
standard blueprint palette for each blueprint resource type. The toolset recognizes the following:
creaturepalstd.itp
doorpalstd.itp
encounterpalstd.itp
itempalstd.itp
placeablepalstd.itp
soundpalstd.itp
storepalstd.itp
triggerpalstd.itp
waypointpalstd.itp
The toolset does not edit the standard blueprint palettes.
Each standard palettes is generated from a skeleton palette by the following procedure:
1. Find all treenodes in the skeleton palette that have a TYPE of 1 or 2 (see Table 2.2.3) and remove
them.
2. Remove all DELETE_ME Fields from all treenodes in the skeleton palette. Exception: if the
STRREF is 0xffff ffff, then rename DELETE_ME to NAME and remove the STRREF Field.
3. Remove the NEXT_USEABLE_ID Field from the skeleton palette's Top Level Struct.
4. Read the RESTYPE from the skeleton palette's Top Level Struct then remove that Field.
5. Find all standard resources (resources in the .BIF files and Override) that have the ResType
specified in the previous step.
6. For each resource found, open it and read the "PaletteID" BYTE Field in its Top Level GFF
Struct.
7. Find the Category node in the palette that has an ID Field matching the PaletteID of the blueprint.
If the Category node does not already have a LIST Field (see Table 2.3.2a), add it. Add a
Blueprint TreeNode (see Table 2.3.3a) to that Category node's LIST.
8. If the blueprint's localized name CExoLocString Field (explained below) contains embedded text,
create a NAME Field in the Blueprint Node, and set it to the embedded text string that matches the
user's own language. Otherwise, create a STRREF Field in the Blueprint Node, and set it to the
StrRef of the localized name field. Different blueprint types use different Fields as their localized
name. Check Table 2.3.4 to determine what GFF Field to use.
9. Set the RESREF Field to the blueprint's ResRef. If the palette is a creature palette, the Blueprint
node should include Challenge Rating and Faction information, as given in Table 2.3.3b.
10. Repeat steps 6 to 9 for all blueprint resources found in step 5.
11. Find all treenodes in the skeleton palette that have a TYPE of 0 (see Table 2.2.3) and remove them
if they have no children. If the node stays, remove its TYPE Field.

2.4. Custom Blueprint Palettes
A custom blueprint palette is a palette that contains blueprint nodes for all the blueprints of a given
resource type within a module.
The toolset recognizes the following custom blueprint palettes:
creaturepalcus.itp
doorpalcus.itp
encounterpalcus.itp
itempalcus.itp
placeablepalcus.itp
soundpalcus.itp
storepalcus.itp
triggerpalcus.itp
waypointpalcus.itp
Custom blueprint palettes have the same GFF structure as standard blueprint palettes.
However, instead of having their blueprint nodes defined by the standard game resources, the blueprint
nodes in a custom blueprint palette are generated by scanning all the resources of the appropriate type
within the custom palette's module.
Also, custom blueprint palettes include Category nodes that were Type 2 in the skeleton palette (see
Table 2.2.3) whereas standard blueprint palettes do not include those Category nodes.
3. Tileset Palettes
3.1. Skeleton Tileset Palettes
A skeleton tileset palette acts as a framework from which a full tileset palette can be generated. They
never appear in the toolset or game.
All skeleton tileset palettes are identical except for their TILESETRESREF Field in the Top Level GFF
Struct. Figure 3.1.1 is a simplified representation of a skeleton tileset palette.

Figure 3.1.2 shows what a skeleton tileset palette should look like in the GFF Editor. In the last Field,
the <resref> value is the only variable one.


## Page 8

BioWare Corp.
http://www.bioware.com
Figure 3.1.2: Skeleton Tileset Palette in GFF Editor

Some internal BioWare tileset palette generation utilities expect the TILESETRESREF Field to have a
value equal to the ResRef of the .set file that the skeleton tileset palette is to be used with. The
following are the skeleton tileset palettes that are included with the original version of the game, and
which follow this resref rule:
tcn01pal.itp
tdc01pal.itp
tde01pal.itp
tdm01pal.itp
tds01pal.itp
tic01pal.itp
tin01pal.itp
tms01pal.itp
ttf01pal.itp
ttr01pal.itp
tcn01pal.itp, for example, has TILESETRESREF = "tcn01".
BioWare's TilePaletteGen program is a command-line application that takes the file path to a
tileset .set file as its single argument. It does not follow the above rule. Instead, it uses the same
skeleton tileset palette (skeletontilepalette.itp) regardless of set file specified, ignoring the
TILESETRESREF Field and using the resref implied by its command line argument instead.
The following tables describe the GFF structure of a skeleton tileset palette.

3.2. Standard Tileset Palettes
A standard tileset palette is a completed tileset palette that contains treenodes for all the tileset groups,
features, terrain types, and crossers that are defined in a corresponding tileset .set file. The naming
convention for a standard tileset palette is <tilesetresref>palstd.itp, where <tilesetresref>
is the ResRef of the tileset's .set file. For example, tcn01.set would have a palette called
tcn01palstd.itp.

### RESREF

CResRef
If parent TreeNode ID == 0 (features):
this is the ResRef of the MDL file for the
Tile to use for this feature.

If parent TreeNode ID == 1 (groups):
this is the ResRef of the first MDL file in
the TileGroup.

If parent TreeNode's ID == 2 (terrain):
this is the name of the TerrainType (Terrain
or Crosser) to paint. This text is all-lower-
case, and is checked against the Terrain and
Crossers defined in the set file via case-
insensitive comparisons. Also, there are two
special terrain nodes, eraser and raise-lower,
that are not directly tied to terrain or
crossers, but which also appear until the
Terrain category.
### STRREF

### DWORD

StrRef indicating the text to display for this
TreeNode Leaf.
Only NAME or STRREF are present but not
both. STRREF overrides NAME if both are
present.
The Features and Groups categories both contain tilegroups from the tileset .set file. The STRREF
Field value is equal to the StrRef of the tilegroup (The StrRef entry in the corresponding [GROUP*]
section in the tileset .set file). The RESREF Field value is equal to the ResRef of the model file used by
the first tileset tile in the tilegroup (The Tile0 entry in the corresponding [GROUP*] section in the
tileset .set file).
The Features list contains tilegroups that contain a single tileset tile. The Groups list contains
tilegroups that contain more than one tileset tile.
As a result of the RESREF Field referencing the first model in a tilegroup, it follows that every
tilegroup in a tileset should use a different tile as its first tile. If two tilegroups both use the same tile as
tile 0, then the toolset will end up using the first tilegroup even when the user tries to paint the second
tilegroup.


## Page 11

BioWare Corp.
http://www.bioware.com
The Terrain category contains both terrain and crossers from the tileset .set file. . The STRREF Field
value is equal to the StrRef of the terrain or crosser (The StrRef entry from the corresponding
[CROSSER*] or [TERRAIN*] section in the tileset .set file).The RESREF Field value is equal to the
Name of the terrain or crosser, converted to all-lower-case (The Name entry from the corresponding
[CROSSER*] or [TERRAIN*] section in the tileset .set file). No two terrains or crossers should have
the same tileset name, or else the toolset will use the first one found and never use the others. The list of
terrain types is checked first, followed by the list of crossers.
There are also two special terrain treenodes that do not directly correspond to any crossers or terrain
types. They are the eraser and raise/lower nodes. Their GFF Field values are summarized in Table
3.2.4. If the toolset encounters their exact RESREF values in a treenode located under the Terrain
category, it automatically goes into its eraser or raise/lower handling system, without checking for a
matching crosser or terrain type. Therefore, no crosser or terrain type should use "eraser" or
"raiselower" as their name.
All tileset palettes include an eraser treenode under the Terrain category. The eraser paints down the
tileset's default terrain type (the Default entry from the [GENERAL] section of the tileset .set file).
If a tileset contains height transitions (as specified by the HasHeightTransition entry in the
[GENERAL] section of the tileset .set file) then the tileset palette should also include a raise/lower
treenode under the Terrain category.
