Faction System
1. Introduction
A Faction is a control system for determining how game objects interact with each other in terms of
friendly, neutral, and hostile reactions.
Faction information is stored in the repute.fac file in a module or savegame. This file uses BioWare's
Generic File Format (GFF), and it is assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with GFF. The
GFF FileType string in the header of repute.fac is "FAC ".
2. Faction System Structs
The tables in this section describe the GFF Structs contained within repute.fac.
2.1. Top Level Struct
Table 2.1: Faction Top Level Struct
Label
Type
Description
FactionList
List
List of Faction Structs (StructID = list index).
Defines what Factions exist in the module.
RepList
List
List of Reputation Structs (StructID = list index).
Defines how each Faction stands with every other
Faction.
2.1.2. Faction Struct
The Table below lists the Fields that are present in a Faction Struct found in the FactionList.
Table 2.1.2.1: Fields in Faction Struct (StructID = list index)
Label
Type
Description
FactionGlobal
### WORD

Global Effect flag.

1 if all members of this faction immediately change
their standings with respect to another faction if just
one member of this faction changes it standings. For
example, if killing one Guard Faction member causes
all Gaurd Faction members to hate you, then the Guard
Faction is Global.

0 if other members of a faction do not change their
standings in response to a change in a single member.
For example, killing a deer will not cause all deer to
hate you.
FactionName
CExoString
Name of the Faction.
FactionParentID
### DWORD

Index into the Top Level Struct's FactionList
specifying the Faction from which this Faction was
derived.
The first four standard factions (PC, Hostile,
Commoner, and Merchant) have no parents, and use
0xFFFFFFFF as their FactionParentID. No other

Factions can use this value.
2.1.3. Reputation Struct
The Table below lists the Fields that are present in a Reputation Struct found in the RepList. Each
Reputation Struct describes how one faction feels about another faction. Feelings need not be mutual.
For example, Exterminators might be hostile to Rats, but Rats may be neutral to Exterminators, so that a
Rat would only attack a Hunter or run away from a Hunter if a Hunter attacked the Rat first.
Table 2.1.3.1: Fields in Reputation Struct (StructID = list index)
Label
Type
Description
FactionID1
### DWORD

Index into the Top-Level Struct's FactionList.
"Faction1"
FactionID2
### DWORD

Index into the Top-Level Struct's FactionList.
"Faction2"
FactionRep
### DWORD

How Faction2 perceives Faction1.
0-10 = Faction 2 is hostile to Faction1
11-89 = Faction 2 is neutral to Faction1
90-100 = Faction 2 is friendly to Faction1
For the RepList to be exhaustively complete, it requires N*N elements, where N = the number of
elements in the FactionList.
However, the way that the PC Faction feels about any other faction is actually meaningless, because
PCs are player-controlled and not subject to faction-based AI reactions. Therefore, any Reputation
Struct where FactionID2 == 0 (ie, PC) is not strictly necessary, and can therefore can be omitted from
the RepList.
Thus, we revise our original statement and say that for the RepList to be sufficiently complete, it
requires N*N - N elements, where N = the number of elements in the FactionList, assuming that one of
those Factions is the PC Faction.
In practice, however, the RepList may contain anywhere from (N*N - N) to (N*N - 1) elements, due to
a small idiosyncrasy in how the toolset generates and saves the list. When a new faction is created, up to
two new entries appear for the PC Faction.
If a Faction Struct does not yet exist for the feelings of the PC Faction toward the new faction's parent,
then that Struct is created:
FactionID1
<Parent ID>
FactionID2
0
FactionRep
100
Regardless of whether the above was created or already existed, a new Faction Struct is created for how
the PC Faction feels about the new faction.
FactionID1
<New ID>
FactionID2
0
FactionRep
100
The reputations are set to 100 in both cases, but remember that the actual reputation value does not
matter if FactionID2 is 0.
From all the above, it follows that a module that contains no user-defined factions will have exactly
N*N - N Faction Structs, where N = 5. Modules containing user-defined factions will have more. The

maximum number of Faction Structs in the RepList is N*N - 1, because the Player Faction itself can
never be a parent faction.
3. Faction-related 2DA Files

3.2. Reputation Adjustment
The file repadjust.2da describes how faction reputation standings change in response to different
faction-affecting actions, how the presence of witnesses affects the changes, and by how much the
changes occur.
Note that certain things affect whether a witness does in fact serve as a witness for its own faction,
including whether the witness is dominated, charmed, is a henchman, or is some other associate, as
well as what faction the master belongs to. These considerations are not part of the Faction file format,
however, and are not discussed further here.
Table 3.2: repadjust.2da
Column
Type
Description
### LABEL

String
programmer label; name of an action.
The rows are: Attack, Theft, Kill, Help.
These action types are hardcoded game constants. Do not
change the order of rows in this 2da. Adding new rows
will have no effect.
### PERSONALREP

Integer
Personal reputation adjustment of how the target feels
about the perpetrator of the action named in the LABEL.
### FACTIONREP

Integer
Base faction reputation adjustment in how the target's
Faction feels about the perpetrator.

This reputation adjustment is modifed further by the effect
of witnesses, as controlled by the columns described
below. Note that a witnesses only affects faction standing
if the witness belongs to a Global faction.
### WITFRIA
