Waypoint Format
1. Introduction
A Waypoint is a simple object type used for scripting and showing map notes to the player.
Waypoints are stored in the game and toolset using BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF), and it is
assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with GFF.
Waypoint objects can be blueprints or instances. Waypoint blueprints are saved as GFF files having a
UTW extension and "UTW " as the FileType string in their GFF header. Waypoint instances are stored
as Waypoint Structs within the a module's GIT files.
2. Waypoint Struct
The tables in this section describe the GFF Struct for a Waypoint object. Some Fields are only present
on Instances and others only on Blueprints.
For List Fields, the tables indicate the StructID used by the List elements.
2.1 Toolset Waypoint Fields
2.1.1 Common Waypoint Fields
The Table below lists the Fields that are present in all Waypoint Structs, regardless of where they are
found.
Table 2.1.1.1: Fields in all Waypoint Structs
Label
Type
Description
Appearance
### BYTE

Index into waypoint.2da.
Determines only what the waypoint model looks like in
the toolset. Has no effect on game.
Description
CExoLocString
Localized description of waypoint. Only visible in
toolset.
HasMapNote
### BYTE

1 if Waypoint has a map note, 0 otherwise.

If HasMapNote == 0, then in the toolset, the "Map
Note Text" and "Map Note Enabled" controls will still
have their proper values as stored in the MapNote and
MapNoteEnabled Fields, but they will be greyed out.
LinkedTo
CExoString
Tag of object that waypoint is linked to. Unused and
always blank.
LocalizedName
CExoLocString
Localized name of waypoint.
This name appears in the Waypoint palette.
MapNote
CExoLocString
Text that appears ingame when user mouses over the
Waypoint in the Minimap.
MapNoteEnabled
### BYTE

1 if the Waypoint's Map Note is visible in the Minimap
in the game, 0 otherwise.
Tag
CExoString
Tag of the waypoint. Can be up to 32 characters long.
The Appearance Field is an index into waypoint.2da, which is described by the table below:

Column
Type
Description
### LABEL

String
Programmer label
### RESREF

String
ResRef of MDL file to use as the model for the waypoint
in the toolset's area viewer.
### STRREF

Integer
StrRef of localized text description to show to user in the
Appearance dropdown in the toolset's Waypoint Properties
dialog.
2.1.2. Waypoint Blueprint Fields
The Top-Level Struct in a UTW file contains all the Fields in Table 2.1.1.1 above, plus those in Table
2.1.2 below.
Table 2.1.2: Fields in Waypoint Blueprint Structs
Label
Type
Description
Comment
CExoString
Module designer comment.
PaletteID
### BYTE

ID of the node that the Waypoint Blueprint appears
under in the Waypoint palette.
TemplateResRef
CResRef
The filename of the UTW file itself. It is an error if this
is different. Certain applications check the value of this
Field instead of the ResRef of the actual file.
If you manually rename a UTW file outside of the
toolset, then you must also update the TemplateResRef
Field inside it.
2.1.3. Waypoint Instance Fields
A Waypoint Instance Struct in a GIT file contains all the Fields in Table 2.1.1.1, plus those in Table
2.1.3 below.
Table 2.1.3: Fields in Waypoint Instance Structs (StructID 5)
Label
Type
Description
TemplateResRef
CResRef
The ResRef of the blueprint that the instance was
created from.
XOrientation
YOrientation
### FLOAT

x and y components of a unit vector that points in the
direction that the waypoint faces.
Or in other words, the cosine and sine, respectively, of
the waypoint's bearing in the xy plane, measured as an
angle counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.
XPosition
YPosition
ZPosition
### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of the Waypoint within the Area
that it is located in.
2.2 Game Waypoint Fields
The information discussed in this section is used only by saved games, and is not required by the
toolset. Editing the fields listed in this section can readily lead to corrupted save games.
After a GIT file has been saved by the game, the Waypoint Instance Struct contains not only the Fields
in Table 2.1.1.1 and Table 2.1.3, it also contains the Fields in Table 2.2.
