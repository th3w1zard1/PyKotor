Encounter Format
1. Introduction
An Encounter is a set of vertices defining a region that can spawn in a set of creatures when creatures of
certain factions enter it.
Encounters are stored in the game and toolset using BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF), and it is
assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with GFF.
Encounter objects can be blueprints or instances. Encounter blueprints are saved as GFF files having a
UTE extension and "UTE " as the FileType string in their header. Encounter instances are stored as
Encounter Structs within a module's GIT files.
2. Encounter Struct
The tables in this section describe the GFF Struct for an Encounter object. Some Fields are only present
on Instances and others only on Blueprints.
For List Fields, the tables indicate the StructID used by the List elements.
2.1 Common Encounter Fields
The Table below lists the Fields that are present in all Encounter Structs, regardless of where they are
found.
Table 2.1.1: Fields in all Encounter Structs
Label
Type
Description
Active
### BYTE

1 if the Encounter is active and can spawn creatures,
0 if inactive. To be able to spawn, an inactive encounter
must be activated via scripting.
CreatureList
List
List of EncounterCreature Structs. StructID 0.
This is a list of the creatures that the Encounter can
spawn.
Difficulty
INT
Obsolete Field. Should always be identical to the
VALUE in encdifficulty.2da pointed to by the
DifficultyIndex Field.
DifficultyIndex
INT
Index into encdifficulty.2da.
Faction
### DWORD

ID of the Faction that the Encounter belongs to. An
Encounter will only spawn creatures if it is entered by
creatures that are hostile to its Faction.
The Faction ID is the index of the Faction in the
module's Faction.fac file.
LocalizedName
CExoLocString
Name of the Encounter as it appears on the toolset's
Encounter palette and in the Name field of the toolset's
Encounter Properties dialog.
Does not appear in game.
MaxCreatures
INT
Maximum number of creatures that this encounter can
spawn at a time. Toolset limits this to 1 to 8.
Must be greater than or equal to MinCreatures.
OnEntered
CResRef
OnEnter event

CResRef

OnExit
CResRef

OnHeartbeat
CResRef
OnHeartbeat event
OnUserDefined
CResRef
OnUserDefined event
PlayerOnly
### BYTE

0 if any creature can fire this Encounter so long as it is
of a hostile faction.
1 if only player characters can fire the encounter. The
player must still be hostile to the Encounter's faction
for the Encounter to fire.
RecCreatures
INT
Recommended number of creatures. Maps to "Min
Creatures" field in toolset, but is not a true minimum,
because it is actually possible for the encounter system
to spawn fewer than this number of creatures if it
cannot find enough creatures to fit the level of the
encounter.
Must be less than or equal to MaxCreatures.
Toolset restricts this Field to the range 1 to 8.
Reset
### BYTE

0 if the Encounter does not respawn.
1 if the Encounter does respawn.
ResetTime
INT
Number of seconds before Encounter respawns.
Maximum in toolset is 32000 seconds.
Respawns
INT
Number of times to respawn. Maximum in toolset is
32000.
-1 if the Encounter can respawn an infinite number of
times.
SpawnOption
INT
0 = continuous spawn. The encounter continuously
evaluates the hostile creatures inside it and spawns new
creatures as the existing creatures die.
1 = single-shot spawn. The encounter fires once when a
hostile creature enters it.
Tag
CExoString
Tag of the Encounter. Up to 32 characters
TemplateResRef
CResRef
For blueprints (UTE files), this should be the same as
the filename.
For instances, this is the ResRef of the blueprint that
the instance was created from.
Table 2.1.2: Fields in EncounterCreature Struct (Struct ID 0)
Label
Type
Description
Appearance
INT
Appearance of the creature.
Should be identical to the Appearance stored in the
creature blueprint.
CR
### FLOAT

Challenge Rating of the creature.
Should be identical to the CR stored in the creature
blueprint.
ResRef
CResRef
ResRef of the creature blueprint (utc file) to spawn an
instance of.
SingleSpawn
### BYTE

0 if there are no restrictions on how many copies of this
creature can spawn.
1 if only one of this creature can spawn at a time in an
encounter.
The Appearance and CR Fields are stored on the EncounterCreature for performance, so that the game
does not have to access the disk to load the blueprint just to get the CR.

2.2. Encounter Blueprint Fields
The Top-Level Struct in a UTE file contains all the Fields in Table 2.1 above, plus those in Table 2.2
below.
Table 2.2: Fields in Encounter Blueprint Structs
Label
Type
Description
Comment
CExoString
Module designer comment.
PaletteID
### BYTE

ID of the node that the Encounter Blueprint appears
under in the Encounter palette.
TemplateResRef
CResRef
The filename of the UTE file itself. It is an error if this
is different. Certain applications check the value of this
Field instead of the ResRef of the actual file.
If you manually rename a UTE file outside of the
toolset, then you must also update the TemplateResRef
Field inside it.
2.3. Encounter Instance Fields
An Encounter Instance Struct in a GIT file contains all the Fields in Table 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, plus those in
Table 2.3.1 of the Trigger Format document, plus those in Table 2.3.1 below.
Table 2.3.1: Fields in Encounter Instance Structs
Label
Type
Description
Geometry
List
List of Point Structs (StructID 1) defining the vertices
of the Encounter polygon. See Table 2.3.2.
The polygon is drawn by starting at the first Point
element and drawing a line to each subsequent Point,
then connecting the last one back to the first.
See section 4 of the Trigger Format document for
additional rules governing the Geometry of an
Encounter polygon.
SpawnPointList
List
List of EncounterSpawnPoint Structs. Struct ID 0.
See Table 2.3.3.
The SpawnPointList is only saved out if the encounter
has spawnpoints defined for it in the toolset.
Spawn points define a set of locations at which the
game may spawn in creatures belonging to the
Encounter. If an Encounter has no defined
spawnpoints, then the game will try to spawn creatures
out of visible range of the creatures that fired the
Encounter.
TemplateResRef
CResRef
For instances, this is the ResRef of the blueprint that
the instance was created from.
XPosition
YPosition
ZPosition
### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of the Encounter within the Area
that it is located in.
The Points in the Encounter Geometry have their
coordinates specified relative to the Encounter's own
location.
Table 2.3.2: Fields in Point Struct (Struct ID 1)
Label
Type
Description
X
Y
Z
### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of the Point, assuming that the
origin is at the owner Encounter's position.


## Page 4

BioWare Corp.
http://www.bioware.com
The points in the Encounter's Geometry List use a coordinate system where the origin is the
Encounter's own position. For example, suppose that an Encounter has (XPosition, YPosition,
ZPosition) = (10, 20, 30). If the Geometry contains a Point at (PointX, PointY, PointZ) = (0, 0, 0), then
the actual coordinates of that Point are (10, 20, 30). Similarly, if there is another Point belonging to the
same Encounter has coordinates (PointX, PointY, PointZ) = (1, 2, -10), then the actual coordinates of
that Point are (11, 22, 20).
There is no requirement that any Point in the List be at (0,0,0), nor is there any requirement against it.

Description
Orientation
### FLOAT

Orientation of the SpawnPoint, expressed as a bearing
in radians measured counterclockwise from north.
X
Y
Z
### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of the SpawnPoint within the Area
that it is located in.
2.4. Encounter Game Instance Fields
After a GIT file has been saved by the game, the Encounter Instance Struct contains not only the Fields
in Table 2.1 and Table 2.3.1, but also those in Table 2.4.

4. Geometry Rules for the Point List
In an Encounter instance, the Geometry List contains the points that define the outline of the
Encounter.
The toolset must enforce several rules for polygon geometry, as given in Section 4 of the Trigger
Format document.
