Sound Set File (SSF) Format
1. Introduction
The Sound Set File (SSF) format is used to store Neverwinter Nights soundset information.
A soundset is a set of sound files to play and associated strings to display when a creature or player
character (PC) performs certain actions or when the creature or PC reacts to certain conditions. For
example, when a PC attacks a creature, the PC may shout a battle cry, with the text of the battle cry
appearing over the PC's head and in the game's message pane. The soundset tells the game what string
to display and what sound file to play.
2. Overall File Format
A SSF contains 3 logical sections: a header, an Entry Table, and a Data Table.
The figure below shows the overall layout of a SSF.

3. Header Format
The header contains file version information and details on how to locate the soundset information in
the file. In the current SSF format, the header is 40 bytes long, but a portion of it is padding, to allow
for the addition of new header information in later revisions of the SSF format.

4. Entry Table
The Entry Table is an array of 32-bit unsigned integers. Each integer entry is a byte offset from the
beginning of the file to an item of data in the Data Table.
In the current form of the SSF format, the Entry Table is not strictly necessary, since the objects in the
Data Table are of fixed size. However, storing the offsets to each one allows for expansion of the SSF
format later to a format in which the data objects may be of variable length.
The figure below shows what the Entry Table looks like. The file header specfiies the number of entries
present.

Entry 0

Entry 1
Entry N - 1
Entry 2
N = EntryCount from the header

5. Data Table
The Data Table stores soundset string and sound file information. It is a sequence of SSF data objects
packed end-to-end, with the starting offset of each one specified in the Entry Table. There is one data
object per entry in the Entry Table.
The figure below shows the layout of the Data Table.

Data N - 1

Each data object in the Data Table has the structure given in the table below.

Value

Description
ResRef
16 char
Name of sound file to play
StringRef
32-bit unsigned
Index to string in dialog.tlk
The ResRef is the name of a .wav sound file to play. This file must be located somewhere in the game
resources (BIF files, Override folder, Hak Paks) and can have up to 16 characters in its name, not
including the .wav file extension. The wave files should be in mono format, since soundset sounds are
played as 3D sound sources in the game engine, and stereo waves do not make sense in that context.

The StringRef identifies a string in the user's dialog.tlk file that should be displayed when the current
sound entry plays in the game. If the StringRef is -1 (ie., 0xFFFFFFFF), then no text appears.
6. Entry Special Meanings
Soundset entries at specific indices have special meanings that remain constant across all soundset files.
For example, the game always interprets the first entry in the Entry Table/Data Table as the "attack"
cry.
The table below describes each soundset entry. Note that the table row Entry numbers start from 1, but
the actual indices start from 0. That is, the Entry index is 1 less than the Entry number.
Also included in the table are the QuickChat keys for sounds that have QuickChat key bindings. To
play a QuickChat in the game, press 'V' followed by the Type key, then the key for the individual
sound. For example, "Attack" is VWE.
Some of the QuickChat entries have an asterisk (*) next to their names. The game will cause these
entries to issue orders to any associates (henchmen, summonded creatures, etc) belonging to the player
character.

7. SoundSet 2da files

Soundset references in the game and toolset are controlled by two 2da files.
Soundset.2da is a centralized source of information about the SoundSet Files that exist in the game
resources. It contains important information about the soundsets that is not stored within the SoundSet
Files themselves. The table below describes the columns in soundset.2da.
Table 7.1: soundset.2da columns
Column
Type
Description
### LABEL

String
Text label for convenience of person reading the 2da
### RESREF

String
ResRef (16-char filename) of SSF file
### STRREF

Integer
Index to string in dialog.tlk
### GENDER

Integer
0 = male, 1 = female
### TYPE

Integer
Index into soundsettype.2da
To reduce network traffic, the soundset used by a creature is not stored as a SoundSet File's ResRef.
Instead, a creature's soundset is stored and transmitted as a single integer index into soundset.2da. From
this index, the game client can consult its own copy of soundset.2da to fetch the ResRef.
The StrRef, Gender, and Type columns in soundset.2da are used by the game and toolset for display
purposes and for filtering which soundsets appear during player character creation and in the toolset's
Soundset Selection dialog. The toolset will not display any soundsets that have a StrRef of 0 or less.
The Type is an index into soundsettype.2da, which is summarized in the table below.
Table 7.2: soundsettype.2da columns
Column
Type
Description
### LABEL

String
Text label for convenience of person reading the 2da
### STRREF

Integer
Index to string in dialog.tlk
The soundset Type is used for filtering the list of selectable soundsets in the toolset. The name
displayed for each type is specified by its StrRef.
As a special case, the game understands Type 0 to refer to player soundsets, and these are the ones that
are displayed during player character creation.
