# IFO

*Official Bioware Aurora Documentation*

> **Note**: This official BioWare documentation was originally written for **Neverwinter Nights**, but the IFO format is **identical in KotOR**. All structures, fields, and behaviors described here apply to KotOR as well. The examples may reference NWN-specific features, but the core format is the same.

**Source:** This documentation is extracted from the official BioWare Aurora Engine IFO Format PDF, archived in [`vendor/xoreos-docs/specs/bioware/IFO_Format.pdf`](https://github.com/th3w1zard1/xoreos-docs/blob/master/specs/bioware/IFO_Format.pdf). The original documentation was published on the now-defunct nwn.bioware.com developer site.

IFO File Format

1. Introduction
An IFO file is a module InFOrmation file. Every NWN module (.MOD or .NWM) or savegame (.SAV)
is an Encapsulated Resource File (ERF) that contains an IFO file called "module.ifo".
The IFO file type is in BioWare's Generic File Format (GFF) and it is assumed that the reader has some
familiarity with GFF. Many of the GFF Fields in an IFO file make references to 2-Dimensional Array
(2DA) files, so it is also assumed that the reader is familiar with the 2DA format.
In the GFF header of an IFO file, the FileType value is "IFO ".
2. Top-Level Struct
2.1 Fields created by Toolset
When a module is saved by the toolset, the Top-Level GFF Struct of the module.ifo file has the Fields
given in the table below.
For List Fields, the table indicates the StructID used by the List elements.
Certain numerical Fields have a range of allowable values, and any application that sets these values
should respect the range limitations because there are no guarantees regarding how the game or toolset
treats invalid values.
Table 2.1: Basic Fields in IFO Top Level Struct
Label
Type
Description
Expansion_Pack

### WORD

Bit flags specifying what expansion packs are required
to run this module. Once a bit is set, it is never unset.
Bit 0 = Expansion 1, Bit 1 = Expansion 2, etc.
Mod_Area_List
List
List of Areas in the module.
StructID 6.
Mod_CacheNSSList List
List of scripts that the game should cache.
StructID 9
Mod_Creator_ID
INT
Deprecated; unused. Is always set to 2.
Mod_CustomTlk
CExoString
Name of a custom TLK file to use with this module.
This name does not include the ".tlk" file extension.

Custom tlk files should be located in the "tlk" folder in
the main game installation directory.

For non-English languages that use dialogF.tlk in
addition to dialog.tlk, the custom tlk file must also have
a "F.tlk" counterpart in the tlk folder.

To refer to a string from the module's custom TLK file,
the StrRef's 0x01000000 bit should be set to 1. The
application will then mask that bit off to 0 and use the
resulting value as the StrRef index into the custom
TLK file instead of the usual dialog.tlk. If the custom

## Page 2

string cannot be found, it will attempt to retrieve the
normal dialog.tlk StrRef.
Mod_CutsceneList List
Deprecated; unused.
Mod_DawnHour

### BYTE

Game hour at which dawn begins (0-23). Area lighting
will begin transitioning from Night to Day colors over
the course of 1 game hour.
Mod_Description
CExoLocString
Description of module
Mod_DuskHour

### BYTE

Game hour at which dusk begins (0-23). Area lighting
will begin transitioning from Day to Night colors over
the course of 1 game hour.
Mod_Entry_Area
CResRef
Module's Starting Area
Mod_Entry_Dir_X
Mod_Entry_Dir_Y

### FLOAT

x and y components of Start Location's direction
vector. This is a unit vector.
Or in other words, the cosine and sine, respectively, of
the waypoint's bearing in the xy plane, measured as an
angle counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.
Mod_Entry_X
Mod_Entry_Y
Mod_Entry_Z

### FLOAT

(x,y,z) coordinates of Module Start Location within the
starting area.
The toolset will refuse to save a module or area until
the start location is located on a walkable portion of a
tileIf the start location ends up on an unwalkable spot
anyway (this may be caused if the tileset tiles or
walkmeshes are in a state of flux) then the game will
spawn players in at the closest walkable point.
Mod_Expan_List
List
Deprecated; unused
Mod_GVar_List
List
Deprecated; unused
Mod_Hak
CExoString
(Obsolete) Hak File used by module, without the ".hak"
extension in its filename. If Mod_HakList exists, this
value is used as the module's Hak Pak. Otherwise, it is
ignored.
Mod_HakList
List
List of Hak Files used by module. Resources from the
first Hak Paks in the list have the highest priority and
override resources in later Hak Paks.
StructID 8.
Mod_ID
Binary
Arbitrarily generated 16-byte number sequence
assigned when toolset creates a new module. It is never
modified afterward by toolset. The game saves out 32
bytes instead of 16. Applications other than the toolset
can set this to all null bytes when creating a new IFO
file.
Mod_IsSaveGame

### BYTE

Boolean indicating if the module is a same game.
0 for modules saved by toolset.
1 for saved games.
Mod_MinGameVer
CExoString
Minimum version of the game and associated game
resources required to run the module. Should be in n.nn
format (eg., "1.26", "1.30"). The game and toolset will
refuse to open a module if the module's minimum
version is greater than the user's current version of the
game. The value of this Field can only increase or stay
the same. If this Field does not exist in the IFO, the
default value is "1.22".
Mod_MinPerHour

### BYTE

Number of real-time minutes per game hour. (1-255)
Mod_Name
CExoLocString
Name of module
Mod_OnAcquirItem CResRef
